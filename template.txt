Rikke: Alright, get that crown off that draugr!

[The crown's reclaimed.]

Rikke: Take that crown back to Solitude, soldier. We'll stay here and see if we
       can find anything ele that could be of use.

[The item is handed back to Tullius at Castle Dour.]

Dragonborn: Here's the Jagged Crown. Legate Rikke sent me to deliver it to you.

Tullius: Excellent work, soldier. I have to admit, I had my doubts it even
         existed. Did you run into any trouble?

         Nothing I couldn't handle.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          That's what I like to hear. I'll get the full report from Legate
          Rikke.

         We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          That's not for you to decide. Soldier¹. I wouldn't have sent you in
          the first place if it wasn't going to be worth it.

         The Stormcloaks were there ahead of us.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Yes. Well, I didn't respond as quickly to the Legate's suggestion as
          perhaps I should have. But at least we ended up with the damn crown.

         Now then... I need someone I can trust to deliver a message of great
         import to Jarl Balgruuf of Whiterun. We have it on good authority that
         Ulfric has raised enough men to attack the city of Whiterun. The Jarl,
         however, refuses the Legion's support. This missive should convince
         him. Be aware soldier, these documents contain sensitive intelligence
         for the Jarl's eyes only.

[MP03] MESSAGE TO WHITERUN |===================================================
___________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player travels to Dragonsreach, the large hilltop castle overlooking the
 city of Whiterun. The Jarl, as usual, is in the throne room.]

Dragonborn: I have an important message from General Tullius.

Balgruuf: No doubt requesting to garrison his men in my castle. How many times
          must I deny him? Well? Out with it.

Dragonborn: Ulfric plans to attack Whiterun. The General wants to lend Legion
            troops.

Balgruuf: • Until that dragon's dealt with, I don't care what Tullius wants.
            For now, give the papers to my steward.

          • I see... Give the papers to my steward.

Dragonborn: I was given strict instructions. For the Jarl's eyes only.

Balgruuf: Don't be daft. Proventus is my eyes. Just give me the letter. I
          presume once I have it, I can do as I please with it? Good.

          • Now, I believe you have some business to conclude with my court
            wizard?

          • Hmm...these are interesting reports...

[Once the nearby dragon problem is dealt with, the Jarl will look Tullius' note
 over with a bit more interest.]

Balgruuf: Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack
          Whiterun...

Proventus: As in all things, my lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.

Irileth: Prey awaits.

Balgruuf: I am of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.

Proventus: You plan to march on Windhelm?

Balgruuf: I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to
          face me as a man, or to declare his intentions.

Proventus: He'll do no such thing!

Irileth: He was rather straight forward¹ with Torygg.

Proventus: Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!

Irileth: That "boy" was High King of Skyrim.

Balgruuf: I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to
          challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll
          prefer to send his "Stormcloaks" to do it for him.

Irileth: True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove
         his army's.

Proventus: Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean,
           if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...

Irileth: Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric
         has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with
         the Empire.

Proventus: And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place
           of your own men?

Balgruuf: It seems cowardly.

Irileth: Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?

Balgruuf: This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to
          the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told.
          And we had to like it.

Proventus: The chests of gold didn't hurt.

Balgruuf: Dammit! This isn't about gold!

Irileth: It's time to decide.

Proventus: Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.

Balgruuf: Oh, he's serious. But so am I.

Irileth: Finally.

Balgruuf: • You there. I have a message for you to deliver to our friend, the
            esteemed Jarl of Windhelm. Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.

          • I've made up my mind, even if my advisors are still squabbling. I'm
            sending you to Windhelm. Deliver this axe to Ulfric Stormcloak.

          An axe?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           How long have you been in Skyrim? Yes. Give the man my axe. If he
           returns it to you it means we have business to settle. If he keeps
           it, then we are at peace.

          And you think Ulfric will let me just walk in there, no trouble?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           True, he's a dangerous and blood thirsty¹ man, but he's also a Nord
           that honors our traditions. Keep your wits about you and you won't
           be harmed. And then get back here. Because if Ulfric isn't bluffing,
           I'll need every able body to defend Whiterun.

          Should I say anything to him?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Men who understand one another need not waste words. There are but
           a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
           Ulfric will know my meaning.

          Understood.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Good. Good...

[The player accepts.]

Balgruuf: Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.

Proventus: Are we writing a letter, my lord?

Balgruuf: Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I
          accept these Legionnaires of his.

[One goes to Windhelm's Palace of the Kings, the seat of Ulfric's power.]

Ulfric: Yes? Make it quick, I'm a busy man.

Dragonborn: i've brought a message from the Jarl of Whiterun.

Ulfric: Is that so? I've been wondering when he'd come around. Oh. What's
        this? Ahhh... You're quite brave to carry such a message. It's a pity
        you've chosen the wrong side... You can return this axe to the man who
        sent it. And tell him he should prepare to entertain...visitors. I
        expect a great deal of excitement in the city of Whiterun in the near
        future...

        You've killed the High King. Why make war on your own people?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I have shown the people that when our Jarls drink the Empire's milk,
         it makes us weak. I must now show them the path that will lead us back
         to our strength. There is no progress without sacrifice. No wheat
         without threshing the chaff. The Empire and the Jarls who back them
         must be swept away. The people demand it. I demand it.

        You will be stopped.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh? True, I may meet my end in a dark alley with a dagger in my back.
         But the people have seen the truth, and they will not back down.

        We'll be seeing you soon.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Sooner than you think.

[The message delivered, it's time to report to Balgruuf. Him, Irileth and the
 Imperial Legate are pouring over strategy as a guard arrives.]

Imperial Guard: Sir! I...I have...

Legate Quentin Cipius: Take a moment to breathe, soldier.

Imperial Soldier: But...sir...

Cipius: Breathe!

Balgruuf: The outer walls are strong. If we can hold them there...

Cipius: They have catapults.

Balgruuf: Damnit. Where did they get catapults? The city walls are already
          falling apart as it is.

Cipius: My scouts tell me they're loading them with fire.

Balgruuf: So, he wants to take my city, walls intact.

Cipius: The men will be fighting in flames. 

Balgruuf: My men are fearless. It's the Imperial milk drinkers I'm worried
          about.

Cipius: If you prefer I took my men and left...

Balgruuf: No. Of course not. Just -- don't let me down¹ Cipius. We'll need to
          set up water brigades to combat the flames.

Cipius: Already taken care of.

Balgruuf: You Imperials are efficient, I'll give you that. How long until they
          arrive?

Imperial Soldier: Sir.

Cipius: Not long. They're hiding in the country side¹.

Balgruuf: Damnit. What's he waiting for?

Imperial Soldier: Sir!

Cipius: What?!

Imperial Soldier: Sir, they're on the move. They'll be at the gates at any
                  moment!

Cipius: Why didn't you say so immediately?!

Imperial Soldier: Sir, I tried.

Balgruuf: This is it! Time to see what these Stormcloaks are made of.

Cipius: The men are already gathering at the gates. Move it¹ soldier. Spread
        the word. Go. Go. Go.

Balgruuf: Oblivion take them. Every miserable last one of them.

[Balgruuf notices the player's returned.]

Balgruuf: You've returned with my axe. I knew that would be his response. As
          soon as you left, I sent word to General Tullius, who's been kind
          enough to lend us some of his troops and Legate Cipius here. Let
          Ulfric try to make it past our combined forces. I'll turn you back
          over to your Legion. Legate Cipius will have use for you. Gods be
          with us all.

          Why side with the Empire?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Mutual advantage! Any fool can see that. For centuries, we have
           benefited from the Empire's protection, and prosperous trade with
           the south. In exchange, the people of Cyrodiil sleep peacefully,
           knowing their northern borders are guarded by the fiercest warriors
           in all Tamriel.

[One seeks out the legate.]

Cipius: The Stormcloaks are here. In force. Get down to the front line. This is
        it. We must hold the city. Now move it!

[MP04] BATTLE FOR WHITERUN |===================================================
___________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[As catapult projectiles start bombarding the city, the player reaches the
 front gate, just as Whiterun troops start showing their ugly mugs.]

Rikke: This is it men! This is an important day for the Empire and for the
       Legion. And for all of Skyrim. This is the day we send a message to
       Ulfric Stormcloak and the rebel Jarls who support him. But make no
       mistake. What we do here today, we do for Skyrim and her people. By
       cutting out the disease of this rebellion, we will make this country
       whole again! Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the
       Legion!

Whiterun Guard: Rrraaaaaggghhhh!

Whiterun Guard: Rrraaaaa!

[The squadron prepares to make a stand at the front and only entrance to the
 city.

Hadvar: You made it? I was sure I'd find you face down in the dirt.

[After a successful rebuff, which decimates Ulfric's boys, the Jarl himself
 goes down to the battle site to congratulate everyone.]

Balgruuf: Revel in your victory here today, even as the gods revel in your
          honor! They already sing of your valor and skill! The halls of
          Sovngarde are no doubt ringing with your praises! In defeating those
          Stormcloak traitors, you have proven the hollowness of their cause
          and the fullness of your hearts. The citizens of Whiterun are forever
          in your debt! But Ulfric will not stop here. No, he will continue to
          strike out against any true Nord who remains faithful to the Empire.
          He will continue to sow discord and chaos wherever he can. And so,
          we must each one of us, continue to fight this insurrection, lest our
          fallen brothers have died for naught! Lest our honor be lessened
          should we allow these bloodthirsty beasts to prowl our lands! Carry
          on men, my gratitude and blessings go with you! For Whiterun! For
          the Empire!

[The soldiers whoop and holler at the praise before dashing back into town.]

Balgruuf: Thank you for your role in all of this. It would be my honor should
          you decide to make Whiterun your home. Speak with Proventus. He'll
          make the necessary arrangements.

[MP05] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM |===============================================

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Following the success at Whiterun, one reports back to the general.]

Tullius: By defeating Ulfric at Whiterun we have solidified the allegiance of
         the Jarl. Perhaps the Stormcloaks will soon lose heart for this little
         rebellion of theirs once and for all. I'm promoting you to Quaestor.
         Take this blade, a symbol of your new station and responsibility. I'll
         keep an eye on your progress. The Empire rewards excellence, and so do
         I.

Dragonborn: What are my new orders, sir?

Tullius: You'd be wasted as a regular soldier. I have special plans for you.
         You'll be of greater use to me with greater flexibility. Make your way
         to our hidden military camp in the Pale. Rikke will have important
         tasks for you, and will need you when we reclaim the capital.

         What exactly will I be doing in the field?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to
          find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.

         Yes sir.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          • For the Emperor!
          • Gods be with you.

[MP06] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM: A FALSE FRONT |================================
______________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player finds the target destination in the snowy northern wilds, finding
 the Imperial bivouac.]

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: I need you to deliver some false orders to the Stormcloak commander in
       Dawnstar. But first we need to get our hands on some rebel orders to
       make the forgeries. The Nightgate and Candlehearth Inns are frequent
       stops for Stormcloak runners. See if you can't "convince" one of those
       innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those documents. But
       don't do anything rash if you go to Windhelm. Well, soldier? Can you do
       this?

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       Consider it done.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        • Good luck out there.
        • Good. Make it happen, soldier.

[If one goes to the Nightgate Inn, info is squeezed from the innkeep. Note
 that the proprietor of the Candlehearth, Elda Early-Dawn, has the exact same
 responses and dialogue here.]

Hadring: Ah, hello there, traveler. Come to the Nightgate for food or lodging?

Dragonborn: Seen any Stormcloak couriers lately?

Hadring: I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.

         His life is in danger. (Persuade)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          • It is? Well that's different.
          • Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.

         Maybe some gold will help (### gold)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          • Well, if you insist...
          • Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.

         I don't have time for this. I can get rough with you if I have to.
         (Intimidate) |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Now, now! That won't be necessary.

         Never mind.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Hmph.

         He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch
         him. Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.

[The player tracks down the Stormcloak Courier.]

Courier: No time to talk. Out of my way.

         I'm not here to talk. I'm here for those documents.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          We'll see about that.

         Never mind.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Hmph.

[With the documents reclaimed, it's back to Rikke.]

Rikke: Very good... Let's see what you have here. Interesting... They know more
       of our plans than I expected... It would seem Fort Dunstad is in need
       of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those... One
       moment while I "correct" some of these documents... That should do it.
       Make sure those forged documents get to the Stormcloak commander in
       Dawnstar. It'll throw him off our trail, allowing us to maneuver more
       freely.

       Remind me -- what am I supposed to do?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        (repeats "Make sure those...")

[The player visits Cmdr. Frorkmar Banner-Torn at the barracks.]

Dragonborn: I have some important documents for you, sir.

Frorkmar: • Is that so? I don't recognize you. Why aren't you wearing your
            Stormcloak colors?

            Dragonborn: Ditched it for this. Easier to sneak past the enemy.

            I suppose it would be. Good thinking.

          All right. Let's take a look... Ah, good. Looks like the
          reinforcements for the fort are on their way. And we have some
          information about enemy troop movements as well. Excellent. It's not
          easy running messages, what with Imperial scouts crawling over the
          place. Well done. Why don't you grab yourself a drink at the Windpeak
          before heading back?

____________________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[One returns to Legate Rikke afterwards.]

Rikke: Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: Your objective is Fort Dunstad. Meet the soldiers preparing for the
       attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we
       will garrison the fort. Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       That fort is as good as ours.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I knew I could count on you, soldier.

[One goes to meet the small band of raiders outside the fort. Together, they
 and other guerilla groups attack en masse, overwhelming the Stormcloaks and
 stealing the fort. With good tidings, it's time to report to the general.]

Tullius: Taking the Pale gives us another port in Dawnstar, and puts us within
         striking distance of Windhelm. That should make Ulfric a bit more
         cautious, eh? Battles are won by trained and disciplined men. Wars
         are won by talented and exceptional individuals. I'm raising you to
         Praefect. Take this blade, as a gift and symbol of your new rank.
         You've earned it.

Dragonborn: What are my new orders, sir?

Tullius: Make your way to our camp in the Rift. We have a few surprises for
         the Stormcloaks lined up.

         What exactly will I be doing in the field?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to
          find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.

         Yes sir.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player next reaches the camp, south of Ivarstead and the Throat of the
 World. Rikke has once again spearheaded the operation here.]

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: You're going to Riften. My spies report the Jarl's steward, Anuriel, has
       arrangements with the Thieves Guild that would be rather embarrassing if
       made public. I need you to find evidence of her corrupt activities, and
       use it to gain a measure of her "cooperation." This will require stealth
       and discretion. The Jarl's guards won't take kindly to anyone rummaging
       through her Steward's private quarters.

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       I'll get proof...and Anuriel's cooperation.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Good. I can always count on you, can't I?

[One visits Riften's Mistveil Keep and finds an incriminating letter in the
 steward's bureau. Then it's time to threaten her.]

Dragonborn: Recognize this? (Show her incriminating letter)

Anuriel: Not here. Come with me. Stay close and the guards will leave you
         alone.

[She leads the player to her chambers.]

Anuriel: I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? Well,
         what is it you want?

         You rebels are doing a fine job destroying yourselves. Soldiers
         running errands? |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          So. You're an Imperial spy... Interesting... I have no strong love
          for the Stormcloaks but I can't say I'm all that fond of the Empire,
          either. This war of yours makes it different for a resourceful woman
          to advance her interests. Perhaps we can find a way for both of us
          to prosper from this unfortunate discovery?

         What if this letter were made public?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          It would ruin me. I have a good thing going here. The Jarl benefits
          from my more creative arrangements as well, though it'd be impossible
          for her to admit that. Laila is a simple and traditional woman. Which
          makes it easy to manipulate her, but impossible to regain her graces
          once offended. Look. Perhaps we could come to some kind of
          arrangement?

Dragonborn: What kind of agreement did you have in mind?

Anuriel: What if I told you about a large shipment of gold and weapons?

          Go on. I'm listening.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Oh, no. I'm no fool. You'll learn what you need to know once we've
           come to an agreement.

           And what about something for me, right now? (Persuade)
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Well I...I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I?
            Very well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?

          How much are we talking about?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Enough to make a significant difference in the war.

          All right, it's a deal. Where can I find this shipment?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           They're taking it by wagon to Windhelm. If you hurry, you'll catch
           them before they get far. It'll be a fairly slow moving¹ caravan.
           The shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.

          Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.

[The player delivers the news to the legate.]

Rikke: Something to report?

Dragonborn: Anuriel says there's a shipment of coin traveling to Windhelm...

Rikke: Excellent work. I knew you'd bring back something useful. It just so
       happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and
       together see if you can't overpower the caravan.

[The troops are near Shor's Watchtower. Hadvar is helping them.]

Hadvar: I remember you...you were with us at Helgen, and Whiterun. Glad to have
        you with us. How are you?

        I'm all right, I guess. How are you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good to hear.

        I've been better. And you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to
         make things better, eh? I guess I'm doing all right.

        I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they
        promoted me after Whiterun. You know, some nights when I close my eyes,
        I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do
        the men you've killed haunt you? Mine do...

         Only a beast kills without feeling.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I suppose you're right...they say it gets easier... I'm not sure if
          that's a good thing...

         If you hadn't killed them, they would have killed you.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          That's what I keep telling myself.

         But, never mind all that. What brings you out this way?

        There's an enemy wagon loaded with coin and weapons. We need to capture
        it. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ¯¯¯¯
         Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a
         day now. So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know
         that?

         I blackmailed Anuriel for the information.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come
          in handy. Lucky for us, that wagon recently had a little accident.

         It doesn't matter.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is. That wagon recently
          had a little accident.

         They're stranded now. Just up the road! We're outnumbered, but I have
         a plan. You got here just in time.

Dragonborn: What's the plan?

Hadvar: First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate
        ourselves overlooking their camp. Next, you'll infiltrate their
        position and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of
        arrows. With a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and
        even the odds a little.

        I have a better plan. You wait here, and I'll take care of it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like
         things have gotten out of hand.

        Let's wait a little longer.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Let me know when you're ready.

        Ready. Let's go.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good.

[If they agree to fight as a team...]

Hadvar: There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him
        a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word. Fire!

[The player kills the sentry quietly.]

Hadvar: All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge.

[Either way, after slaying the Stormcloaks:]

Hadvar: We make quite a team, eh? I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You
        get back to camp with news. Have them send some men -- with a new
        wagon. This one isn't going anywhere.

[MP09] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM: THE BATTLE FOR FORT GREENWALL |================
______________________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[One goes back to Rikke.]

Rikke: Good work. I'll send some men with a wagon to collect the prize. We
       can use the weapons here, and I'll pass on the coin to Solitude.

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: Your objective is Fort Greenwall. Meet the soldiers preparing for the
       attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail we
       will garrison the fort. Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       That fort is as good as ours.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I knew I could count on you, soldier.

[As before, one goes visits the fort and slays its Stormcloak inhabitants. As
 they lie bleeding, it's time to revisit the general for due accolades.]

Tullius: Taking control of the Rift was a great victory. Ulfric must be rather
         nervous with us so close to his door step¹.

Dragonborn: What are my new orders, sir?

Tullius: You're needed in Winterhold. Report to our hidden camp there.

         What exactly will I be doing in the field?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          You'll be doing whatever Rikke tells you to do. And, I expect you to
          find creative ways to disrupt the Stormcloaks along the way.

         Yes sir.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          • Gods be with you.
          • For the Empire!

[The player can inquire about the hostilies' state.]

Dragonborn: How goes the war?

Tullius: There's not much up there, but if we can regain Winterhold, our
         proximity to Windhelm should keep Ulfric wary and wasting troops
         garrisoned at home. By holding onto Falkreath, we control access to
         the Reach, Whiterun, and the Rift. Ulfric will try for it soon. We'll
         be there to stop him.

Dragonborn: What will it take to end the war?

Tullius: Ulfric Stormcloak's head rolling away from his lifeless body.

[MP10] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM: RESCUE FROM FORT KASTAV |======================
________________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[As usual, one meets Rikke at the designated camp.]

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: Your objective is Fort Kastav. The rebels are keeping some of our men
       prisoner there. I aim to turn that into an advantage. I've sent men to
       scout the area. You are to meet them, find a way to slip in, free our
       men, and take over the fort. They won't be expecting an attack from the
       inside. This won't be easy, but that's why I'm sending you. Think you
       can handle it?

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       That fort is as good as ours.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        • I knew I could count on you, soldier.
        • Show the rebels the futility of their cause.

[Upon arrival, the player finds the scouting party is lead by Hadvar.]

Hadvar: Hey there! Can you believe this place? So cold my breath turns to
        icicles! What are we even doing up here? Guess Tullius wants to make
        sure everything's locked down before launching a serious campaign for
        Eastmarch. Anyway, I'm glad you're here. We're outnumbered again, more
        so than when we took that wagon. But if we work together, we can pull
        this off.

Dragonborn: What's the plan?

Hadvar: There's a grate outside the wall. Looks like it used to be buried in
        snow. I don't think they know it's there. From the look of it, I'd bet
        it leads straight into the prison. I need you to sneak in there, and
        free our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the
        prisoners, head out to the courtyard. We'll stand guard out here and
        rush in as soon as we hear fighting.

        I'm on it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Talos preserve you.

        I'm not much for sneaking.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I have faith in you. But, if you find more trouble than you can
         handle, run out to the courtyard. We'll come as soon as we hear
         fighting.

[The player finds the grate, infiltrating the prison as expected. No guards
 are around, but the prisoners are all up and at 'em.]

Imperial Soldier: Hey!

Imperial Soldier: Hurry!

[The player frees them and they reclaim their confiscated gear, killing any
 Stormcloaks en route to the courtyard. The rest soon fall as well.]

Hadvar: Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean
        up the mess. Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!

[One reports back to Solitude.]

Tullius: Now that we have Winterhold, I can garrison some troops there until
         I'm ready to march on Windhelm. I have come to rely heavily on you.
         It is only fitting that you join the upper eschelon. I am hereby
         elevating you to the rank of Legate. On behalf of the Empire, and
         myself, please accept this gift along with your new rank. 
         Congratulations.

Dragonborn: What's next?

Tullius: You've little time to glory in your accomplishments. We're gathering
         for our final assault on Windhelm. Report to our camp in Eastmarch.

[MP11] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM: THE BATTLE FOR FORT AMOL |=====================
_________________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Rikke is found in the mountainside camp near Mzulft.]

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Rikke: Your objective is the enemy held¹ fort. Meet the soldiers preparing for
       the attack. Then join them in wiping out the rebels. Once you prevail
       we will garrison the fort. Well, soldier? Are you up to the task?

       I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Don't take too long figuring it out. I've got a war to run here.

       That fort is as good as ours.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I knew I could count on you, soldier.

[The player visits Fort Amol, a riverside holding in the Eastmarch hills. The
 orchestrated assault works perfectly, as usual. One reports back to Rikke.]

Rikke: Good job! I knew I gave the mission to the right person.

Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Rikke: We're taking the city. Meet the soldiers gathering for the attack. Move
       it!

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
[MP12] REUNIFICATION OF SKYRIM: BATTLE FOR WINDHELM |==========================
____________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player meets the men and Tullius at Windhelm's bridge entrance. He takes
 no time in rousing his men to glory.]

Tullius: All right! It's time to deliver the final blow to the Stormcloak
         rebellion! You have all fought bravely, and sacrificed much to bring
         us to this point. Ulfric thinks he can hide behind the walls of his
         castle. But we will fight our way in and drag him out through the
         rubble to face justice. Because this is the end for them, the
         Stormcloaks will fight like cornered rats. They will be fierce and
         crafty. But they are no match for Legionnaires. You are the best and
         the brightest warriors in Tamriel. Professional soldiers, fearless and
         devastating. The Emperor will be paying close attention to what
         happens here today. Men who distinguish themelves will be well
         rewarded. Ready now! Everyone, with me! For the Empire! For the
         Legion! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!

[With the attack orders given, the stone town of Windhelm quickly becomes a
 bloodbath, everyone trading blows in the bonfires and rubble. Eventually, the
 herds are thinned and the Imperials fight to the Palace of the Kings. Ulfric
 sits leisurely at his throne. Tullius and Rikke follow the player.]

Tullius: Secure the door.

Rikke: Already done, sir.

Tullius: Ulfric Stormcloak! You are guilty of insurrection, murder of Imperial
         citizens, the assassination of King Torygg, and high treason against
         the Empire. It's over.

Galmar: Not while I'm still standing, it's not.

Rikke: Step aside, Galmar. We're here to accept Ulfric's surrender.

Ulfric: I'll never surrender Skyrim to the hands of a corrupt and dying Empire.

Rikke: Skyrim doesn't belong to you, Ulfric.

Ulfric: No... But I belong to her.

Tullius: Enough! You are traitors and will die traitors' deaths. Stand down and
         face public execution, or advance and face summary execution by my
         hands. It matters little to me. Either way I'll be sending your heads
         back to Cyrodiil.

Galmar: Well? What are we waiting for?

[They brandish their weapons, starting the final battle.]

Tullius: Die villain!

Ulfric: Talos smite you!

[Galmar is slain, and Ulfric terribly wounded.]

Tullius: Well Ulfric, you can't escape from me this time. Any last requests
         before I send you to...to wherever you people go when you die.

Rikke: Sovngarde...sir.

Tullius: Right. Well?

Ulfric: Let the Dragonborn be the one to do it. It'll make for a better song.

Tullius: Song or not, I just want it done.

         I've had my fair share of killing today.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Well, I'm not quite done myself.

         I won't give him the satisfaction.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Fine by me.

         I'll gladly kill him.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Here, use my sword to do it. I made sure to sharpen it for the
          occasion.

[Ulfric's death sentence is carried out by the player or Tullius.]

Ulfric: Aggh..¹

Rikke: Talos be with you...

Tullius: What was that, Legate?

Rikke: Nothing. Just saying goodbye.

Tullius: Well, the men will be expecting some kind of speech. And we'll need
         to hand the city over to that Free-Winter fellow.

Rikke: Brunwulf. Yes, I've sent men to protect him and bring him here. Windhelm
       will need a government quickly if we are to prevent more violence.

Tullius: The Legion will be staying here for quite some time. I don't expect
         there to be any further violence.

[He turns to the player.]

Tullius: Oh, and Legate. It's been an honor to have you at my side. As a token
         of my appreciation, I want you to keep my sword. And now, to deliver
         a speech.

[Everyone goes outside to the waiting Imperial throng.]

Tullius: His head will be sent to Cyrodiil where it will adorn a spike on the
         walls of the Imperial City. Let this day be a final warning to all
         who would still call themselves Stormcloaks. We are turning the city
         over to Brunwulf Free-Winter, an honorable and faithful man. Many of
         you will be staying in Windhelm to aid the Jarl in restoring order
         and stamping out any embers of rebellion that may still smolder here.
         In appreciation for your exemplary service, I am doubling your pay and
         compensation to the widows of your fallen comrades.

Imperial Soldiers: Rrrraaaaaaggghhh!

Tullius: I am proud of all of you. All hail the Emperor! All hail his
         Legionnaires!

Imperial Soldiers: Rrrraaaaaaggghhh!

Tullius: I hate giving speeches.

Rikke: It wasn't so bad.

Tullius: I hope we haven't just created a martyr.

Rikke: There's bound to be resistance. There are many Stormcloak camps tucked
       away in the hills. They'll no doubt strike whenever and wherever they
       can. But without Ulfric to inflame their passions, they'll settle down
       and return to their homes eventually.

Tullius: I pray you're right, Legate. In the meantime, we'll continue to root
         them out and put them to the sword.

[He turns to the player.]

Tullius: We couldn't have done this without you. The Empire glories in your
         accomplishments... Come, Rikke. There's still much to be done.

[Tullius can be asked about the aftermath.]

Dragonborn: Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?

Tullius: The fiercest of the remaining rebels will continue to harass us, but
         by in¹ large, the people here desire peace. What I'm not so sure about
         is the peace we've made with the Thalmor. But we'll kee that between
         the two of us, alright?

Dragonborn: Will you return to Cyrodiil now?

Tullius: No, I suspect Skyrim to be my home for many years. Can't say I'll ever
         get used to the damn cold, or understand these Nords...but, I've come
         to respect them. The harshness of Skyrim has a way of carving a man
         down to his true self.

Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?

Tullius: Ulfric is dead and his army destroyed. There's not much more I could
         ask of you. The gods, however, I suspect, may have plans for you
         elsewhere. That said, Stormcloak true believers are still operating
         out of hidden military camps in the hills. If you encounter any on
         you¹ travels, kill them. With luck, they'll soon lose heart and return
         to their homes and families. If not, we'll be forced to put them all
         to the sword.

[Rikke can be asked about the aftermath.]

Dragonborn: Now that Ulfric is dead, will there be peace?

Rikke: There are those who still call themselves Stormcloaks, who continue to
       fight us, and bring misery to the people...but they are few in number.
       The ordinary citizen will be happy to get back to life as normal, to
       have their families return home. And they should enjoy it while they
       can...I suspect all of Tamriel will againb e called to arms in the not
       too distant future.

Dragonborn: What's next for the accomplished Legate Rikke?

Rikke: The General's put me in charge of assisting the new governments. I may
       understand things here in Skyrim better than the General, but I'm a
       soldier at heart, not a politician. But I'll do my best. This is the
       land of my birth, the land that shaped me. I'm proud to have any part
       in making it strong again.

Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the Legion?

Rikke: The Legion's work is far from finished, but you are free to roam. I
       suspect you'll be of greater good to Skyrim out there, in the world.
       If while you're out there, you stumble into any Stormcloak military
       camps, I expect you to destroy them. I've reports they are hiding in the
       hills.

[ST01] JOINING THE STORMCLOAKS |===============================================
_______________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Like the Imperial side, one overhears talk of joining the Stormcloaks, based
 out of Windhelm. If it catches one's fancy, a visit to the Palace of the Kings
 is necessary to get the ball rolling. There, Ulfric and his housecarl, Galmar
 Stone-Fist, will be talking.]

Galmar: If he's not with us, he's against us.

Ulfric: He knows that. They all know that.

Galmar: How long are you going to wait?

Ulfric: You think I need to send Balgruuf a stronger message.

Galmar: If by message you mean shoving a sword through his gullet.

Ulfric: Taking his city and leaving him in disgrace would make a more powerful
        statement, don't you think?

Galmar: So we're ready to start this war in earnest then?

Ulfric: Soon.

Galmar: I still say you should take them all out like you did Deadking Torygg.

Ulfric: Torygg was merely a message to the other Jarls. Whoever we replace them
        with will need the support of our armies.

Galmar: We're ready when you are.

Ulfric: Things hinge on Whiterun. If we can take the city without bloodshed¹
        all the better. But if not...

Galmar: The people are behind you.

Ulfric: Many I fear still need convincing.

Galmar: Then let them die with their false kings.

Ulfric: We've been soldiers a long time. We know the price of freedom. The
        people are still weighing things in their hearts.

Galmar: What's left of Skyrim to wager? 

Ulfric: They have families to think of.

Galmar: How many of their sons and daughters follow your banner? We are their
        families.

Ulfric: Well put, friend. Tell me, Galmar, why do you fight for me?

Galmar: I'd follow you into the depths of Oblivion, you know that.

Ulfric: Yes, but why do you fight? If not for me, what then?

Galmar: I'll die before elves dictate the fates of men. Are we not one in this?

Ulfric: I fight for the men I've held in my arms, dying on foreign soil. I
        fight for their wives and children, who's¹ names I heard whispered in
        their last breaths. I fight for we few who did come home, only to find
        our country full of strangers wearing familiar faces. I fight for my
        people impoverished to pay the debts of an Empire too weak to rule
        them, yet brands them criminals for wanting to rule themselves! I fight
        so that all the fighting I've already done hasn't been for nothing. I
        fight...because I must.

Galmar: Your words give voice to what we all feel, Ulfric. And that's why you
        will be High King. But the day words are enough, will be the day
        soldiers like us are no longer needed.

Ulfric: I would gladly retire from the world were such a day to dawn.

Galmar: Aye. But in the meantime, we have a war to plan.

[The player walks over.]

Ulfric: Only the foolish or the courageous approach the Jarl without summons...
        Do I know you?

        I believe we've already met.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Is that so...? Ah yes, you were with us at Helgen.

        I was at Helgen.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ahhh. Yes...

        Destined for the chopping block if I'm not mistaken.

        I helped Ralof escape. He said he'd vouch for me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ralof's alive? I hope that's true. He's a damn good man. But he hasn't
         returned yet, so I'll need to wait for his account. For now, speak
         with Galmar.

        I was set free. I could've gone anywhere. I came here to fight the
        Empire. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         A fair point... Well, you've come to the right place, then. Speak
         with Galmar.

        I'm always looking for able fighters. Not everyone can say they made it
        out of Helgen. Seems we're all branded villains these days... So long
        as your criminal past stays in the past, and you fight for me with
        honor and integrity, we'll welcome you into our ranks.

[If one is far enough in the main quest, Ulfric may instead say this, before
 giving the usual chatty options:]

Ulfric: I remember you... You were at Helgen with us! Come to join the war?
        Speak with Galmar. He handles the new recruits.

        Yes, sir.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good.

        That's not why I'm here.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I'm sorry to hear that. If you change your mind, speak with Galmar.
         What does bring you to me?

[One finds Galmar nearby.]

Galmar: Hmm. Helgen, eh? Ulfric told us quite the story. If you made it through
        that, you're likely worth something to me. But first, tell me. Why's a
        foreigner want to fight or Skyrim?

        Skyrim is my home.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Fair enough. But are you willing to die for your home?

        I want to fight the Empire. I'll bleed for the chance to do so.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Can't fault anyone for that! As long as you hate the Empire as much
         as I do, that I can work with.

Dragonborn: That's why I'm here. I want to join.

Galmar: All right. But before I can put you to use, I need to know how much
        you can take. I have a little test for you.

        I can handle anything you throw at me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's what I like to hear. So long as you can back up those words
         with steel.

        What kind of test?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The kind men use to measure themselves.

        I'm sending you to Serpentstone Island. If you survive, you pass. If
        you die, well, you weren't going to be much use to me anyway.

Dragonborn: What's at Serpentstone Island?

Galmar: It's where men have tested their mettle for ages. There's a strange
        rock formation there, built by the ancients. Something about that
        place attracts the Ice Wraiths. You kill an Ice Wraith out there, and
        I'll have the proof I need about you.

        Does every recruit have to do this?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Only the ones I'm not sure about. This will prove your abilities, but
         more importantly, it will prove your commitment.

        I'm going alone?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Not so sure of yourself after all?

         At the end of the day, every warrior is alone. Before you can stand
         next to your shield brother, you need to be able to stand on your own.

        I'm not sure about this.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         When you kill that Ice Wraith, then we'll talk about you becoming a
         Stormcloak.

        I'm off to kill that Ice Wraith. I'll be back soon.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         We'll see about that, won't we?

[The glacial island is found off the northeast coast of Skyrim. Sure enough,
 ice wraiths spawn there. One returns to Galmar after slaying the beastie.
 Him and the Jarl are discussing another matter fervently.]

Ulfric: Tell me again why we're wasting time and resources chasing a legend. We
        don't even know it exists!

Galmar: The Jarls are upset. They don't all support you.

Ulfric: Damn the Jarls.

Galmar: They demand the Moot.

Ulfric: And damn the Moot! We should risk letting those milkdrinkers put
        Torygg's woman on the throne? She'll hand Skyrim over to the elves on
        a silver plate.

Galmar: All the more reason then. The crown would legitimize your claim.

Ulfric: A crown doesn't make a king.

Galmar: No, but this one...

Ulfric: If it even exists.

Galmar: It exists. And it'll be the symbol of the righteousness of our cause.
        Think about it. The Jagged Crown! It heralds back to a time before
        jarls and moots. Back to a time when a king was a king because his
        enemies fell before him, and his people rose because they loved him.
        Skyrim needs that king. You will be that king, Ulfric. You must be.

Ulfric: You're certain you've found it?

Galmar: When have I ever been false with you?

Ulfric: Fine. I'll send the Unblooded here with you. Fancy a crawl through a
        moldering dungeon to see if you can't stir up Galmar's Jagged Crown?

Galmar: It'll be there. You'll see.

[They finish talking. Galmar walks over.]

Galmar: You're alive. I owe Ulfric a drink. I have to admit, I didn't think
        we'd be seeing you again. I misjudged you. You're definitely Stormcloak
        material. It's time we made this official. You ready to take the Oath?

        Are you saying you sent me out there to die?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Not at all. That was as much a test of your abilities as it was your
         resolve. I wasn't sure your heart was in it. But you've proven me
         wrong. And I respect that. Now, if were¹ done being sentimental, it's
         time for you to take the Oath.

        Oath?
        ¯¯¯¯¯
         Before you're one of us, you must swear fealty to Jarl Ulfric
         Stormcloak, future High King of Skyrim. You must also pledge
         unswerving loyalty to your fellow Stormcloaks, to Skyrim and to her
         people.

        Isn't it enough that I want to fight Imperials?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You can stick a sword through an Imperial any day you want. But that
         doesn't make you a Stormcloak. We're not just fighting Imperials.
         We're fighting to restore Skyrim to her glory and give her the king
         she deserves.

        I need to think it over.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Don't take too long figuring it out. Might mistake your hesitation
         for Imperial sympathies. Come back when you're committed to the cause,
         or go join the Legion. They're taking anyone with a pulse these days.

        I'm ready to take the Oath.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's the spirit.

[The player agrees to take the oath.]

Galmar: By swearing this oath, you become one of us. A hero of the people. A
        true son of Skyrim. A Stormcloak. Repeat after me. "I do swear my
        blood and honor to the service of Ulfric Stormcloak..."

Dragonborn: "I do swear my blood and honor to the service of Ulfric
            Stormcloak..."

Galmar: "...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim."

Dragonborn: "...Jarl of Windhelm and true High King of Skyrim."

Galmar: "As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and beyond..."

Dragonborn: "As Talos is my witness, may this oath bind me to death and
            beyond..."

Galmar: "...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms."

Dragonborn: "...even to my lord as to my fellow brothers and sisters in arms."

Galmar: "All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!"

Dragonborn: "All hail the Stormcloaks, the true sons and daughters of Skyrim!"

Galmar: Now you're one of us. Which means you get to tag along on a little trip
        with me. Oh, and here. You're a Stormcloak now, you ought to look the
        part.

[ST02] THE JAGGED CROWN |======================================================
________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

Dragonborn: What's the mission?

Galmar: I have found the final resting place of the Jagged Crown. Can you
        believe it? Well, I'm almost certain. We're headed to Korvanjund. But,
        if old King Borgas is indeed buried there, we're bound to run into
        trouble of some kind. Your fellow Stormcloaks are already assembling
        outside the tomb. I'll meet you there as soon as I'm finished up here.
        Don't wait around for me. I bet I'll beat you to Korvanjund even though
        you start first.

[The player can inquire further.]

Dragonborn: What's the Jagged Crown?

Galmar: Have you not heard that ancient verse? "Maw unleashing razor snow, Of
        dragons from the blue brought down, Births the walking winter's woe,
        The High King in his Jagged Crown." Going way back to King Harald's
        time or even before, the High King always wore the Jagged Crown. It
        was the symbol of his might and power. The crown is made from the
        bones and teeth of ancient dragons, and it is said to contain a portion
        of the power of every king who has worn it. True or not, who would dare
        deny Ulfric's claim, when the legendary Jagged Crown sits upon his
        brow?

Dragonborn: How do you know the crown is in Korvanjund?

Galmar: It's true, the location of the crown was lost with King Borgas. After
        the Great Hunt killed him, while he was off on his damned Alessian
        campaigns. But legend holds, his body was secretly returned to Skyrim
        and buried with the crown. Its exact whereabouts lost in the following
        Wars of Succession. Through sources that shall remain nameless, I've
        tracked down what I believe to be the final resting place of King
        Borgas -- Korvanjund. If the crown exists, it will be there.

Dragonborn: You anticipate danger?

Galmar: Aye. The Great Hunt killed old King Borgas. Gods only know with what
        profane arts those elves cursed his remains. Curses nonwithstanding,
        the tombs of kings are always full of traps to ward off grave robbers,
        are they not? But nothing a band of Stormcloaks can't handle, I assure
        you.

[They arrive at the snowy tomb, about halfway between Whiterun and Windhelm.
 Galmar and his troops are waiting nearby. Ralof, met during the game's first
 chapter, will run over at this point.]

Ralof: Ha, I knew you'd join up! Great news. We'll take back Skyrim together,
       eh? I'm glad I'll have you beside me in there. This place chills my
       blood, and I don't care who knows it.

Dragonborn: What are you talking about?

Ralof: These old ruins... My father always told me to stay away from them. Good
       advice, I'd say. But never mind all that. We've got a job to do, and
       nothing's going to stand in our way.

[They walk to the main group together.]

Galmar: Hail, Ilfhild.

Stormcloak Soldier: Hail, Galmar.

Galmar: What's the situation?

S. Soldier: Cold as the inside of an ice wraith. That and some Imperials are
            camped out around the entrance, staying nice and warm around their
            fires.

Galmar: Imperials? Well, if they're keeping themselves comfortable, let's slip
        in and send them to their graves that way.

[Galmar sees the player's arrived.]

Galmar: What's the Legion doing here? Damn Imperial spies... Well, should be
        fun for us, at least. They don't seem to know we're here yet. Ready to
        spill some Imperial blood for Skyrim?

        Hold on. I need a minute.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Even the Imperials might eventually decide to patrol their perimeter.
         Get yourself ready!

        I'm ready. Let's go get them.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's what I like to hear.

        Listen up. Those Imperials aren't here by coincidence. Their spies
        must have found out we know about the Crown, and they don't want us
        to have it. But they won't stand in our way. I know some of you are
        ex-legion¹ and may know men on the other side. But remember this. They
        are the enemy now and they will not hesitate to kill you. Keep your
        wits about you and watch your shield brother's back. Ulfric Stormcloak
        is counting on us to bring him back that crown, and that's exactly what
        we are going to do. Follow me. Quickly and quietly now. I want their
        guts on the ground before they even know we're here.

[They slaughter the gate guards and slip inside undetected.]

Galmar: Pick a man and put him down. We attack on my signal. Time to show what
        you're really made of. For Skyrim!

[They slay the nearby patrolmen.]

Galmar: Gretta, Engar, stay and guard the entrance. We don't want any Imperial
        reinforcements taking us by surprise. The rest of you lot are with me.

[They soon reach a long, thin stairway.]

Galmar: I don't like the look of this. Perfect spot for an ambush. Ten to one
        they're just waiting for us on the other side.

Stormcloak Soldier: But there isn't any other way through.

Galmar: You sure about that? Then please, be my guest and go strolling on in
        there. We'll stay here and watch your back... Not so sure? Oh, then
        perhaps we should take a moment to look around a little, eh? You there,
        Unblooded, see if you can find another way through. We'll charge in to
        help as soon as we hear fighting. There may be some way to get through
        on the level above. Hurry!

[Using the upper route, the player reconnoiters, overhearing two sentries.]

Imperial 1: You hear anything?

Imperial 2: No, but I know they're out there. No other way they can come. Now
            shut up or you'll blow our ambush.

Imperial 1: I don't like it. What are they waiting for?

Imperial 2: Maybe they're so scared of you they ran away.

Imperial 1: Hardly likely.

Imperial 2: Just shut up and keep out of sight.

[The player attacks.]

Imperial Soldier: It must be the Stormcloaks! Attack!

[They slay 'em.]

Galmar: Careful, boys. There's bound to be more up ahead.

[They pick off a straggler. Nearby is a draugr and a fresh corpse.]

Stormcloak 1: What in the nine holds is that?

Stormcloak 2: Draugr. Ain't you ever seen one before?

Stormcloak 1: No. And I'm not sure I'm better off for it now neither.

Galmar: Steady. A few dusty bonewalkers aren't going to stop us anymore than
        the Imperials could. We're not leaving until we get what we came for.
        Now let's keep moving.

[They progress deeper into the crypt, coming upon the tunnel and puzzle lock.]

Galmar: Ah! The Hall of Stories...we must be getting close now.

Stormcloak 1: Oh...I've heard of this. They say these walls show the history of
              the ancients who built this place.

Stormcloak 2: Too bad we can't read these carvings. Who knows what secrets
              we'd uncover?

Galmar: One thing at a time. We're here for the Crown. Any of these carvings
        show a crown?

[An Imperial corpse is nearby.]

Galmar: Hmm, looks like this is as far as the Imperials got. Even if one of
        these pictures tells us where the Crown is, I'm betting we're going to
        have to find a way through that door. See what you can figure out,
        Unblooded. I'm going to check out these carvings over here. Let me know
        if you find something.

[The corpse has a claw nearby.]

Galmar: Hmm...that looks like some kind of claw from a statue. I wonder what
        it's used for.

[Using the claw, the puzzle door's opened.]

Galmar: Good job! Alright everyone! Keep your guard up. No telling what we'll
        find down here.

[They reach a larger chamber.]

Galmar: Come on, boys. Let's spread out and see what we've got. Unblooded, do
        what you do best. See if you can find some way to get that gate open.

[A lever up top opens the gate.]

Galmar: That's done it! Alright, boys, let's get moving. We've got more...

[Draugr pop out of the coffins.]

Stormcloak: Look out! Draugr!

Galmar: Steady now! They may be uglier than Imperials but they'll go down just
        the same.

[The undead are laid to rest.]

Galmar: Let's hope that's the last of them. Come on, let's see what's down
        this way.

[Finally, the team comes across the deepest tomb.]

Galmar: The crown must be around here somewhere. Spread out, and keep your eyes
        open.

Ralof: Hey, I found a crown over here on this corpse. Is this the one we're
       looking for?

Galmar: Ralof...get away from there, fool!

[High-level draugr reanimate nearby. Afterwards, the player finds the Crown.]

Galmar: Get to Windhelm with the crown as quick as you can. Tell Ulfric he owes
        me a drink. We'll stick around here for a while and see if we can find
        anything else useful.

[The headgear is delivered to Ulfric personally.]

Dragonborn: Here's the Jagged Crown. I believe you owe Galmar a drink?

Ulfric: Damn him -- the old bear was right! Did you run into any trouble?

        Nothing I couldn't handle.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's the spirit. I'll get all the details from Galmar when he gets
         back.

        We lost a lot of good men. I hope it was worth it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The blood of our fallen heroes will make Skyrim free, never doubt it.
         Also, never doubt me or Galmar.

        The Imperials were there ahead of us.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Damn it. What were they doing there? Imperial spies are everywhere.
         Never forget that... I trust you gave them a thrashing? 

        Now then... I'm glad you're here. I have a message I need delivered to
        the Jarl of Whiterun. Deliver this axe to Balgruuf the Greater.

        An axe?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes. An axe. How long have you been in Skyrim.¹ Give the man my axe.
         If he keeps it, I will bide my time. If he returns it to you, it means
         war.

        Should I say anything to him?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Men who understand each other often have no need for words. There are
         but a few simple truths behind one warrior giving another his axe.
         Balgruuf will know my meaning.

Dragonborn: Understood.

Ulfric: Keep your wits about you. The Jarl of Whiterun is known for his temper.

___________________________
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯|
[ST03] MESSAGE TO WHITERUN |===================================================
___________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The Jarl's sought out at Dragonsreach, the hilltop castle overlooking his
 fair city.]

Dragonborn: Jarl Ulfric Stormcloak asked me to deliver this axe to you.

Balgruuf: Did he now? The man is persistent, I'll give him that.

          • But until that dragon's dealt with, Ulfric's just going to have to
            wait. For now, I'll hold onto this axe. But it's a tenuous peace at
            best. Now I believe you have some business to conclude with my
            court wizard?

          • I suppose it's time I give him an answer... Proventus, what do you
            make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...

Proventus: As in all things, Lord, caution...I urge us to wait and see.

Irileth: Prey waits.

Balgruuf: I'm of a mind with Irileth. It's time to act.

Proventus: You plan to march on Windhelm?

Balgruuf: I'm not a fool, Proventus. I mean it's time to challenge Ulfric to
          face me as a man, or march his Stormcloaks up to the gates.

Proventus: He'll do no such thing! A dagger in the back is all you could
           expect!

Irileth: He was rather straight forward¹ with Torygg.

Proventus: Torygg? He simply walked up to the boy and murdered him!

Irileth: That "boy" was the High King of Skyrim.

Balgruuf: I'm not the High King, but neither am I a boy. If Ulfric wants to
          challenge my rule in the old way, let him. Though I suspect he'll
          prefer to send his "Stormcloaks" to do it for him.

Irileth: True. He's already proven his personal strength. Now he seeks to prove
         his army's.

Proventus: Then might I urge you to consider General Tullius's request? I mean,
           if you are bent on offending Jarl Ulfric...

Irileth: Ulfric is the one who has offended. But, Proventus has a point. Ulfric
         has made it clear. In his mind, to refuse his claim is to side with
         the Empire.

Proventus: And what harm is there in letting a few Legionnaires die in place
           of your own men?

Balgruuf: It seems cowardly.

Irileth: Was it cowardly then to accept the White-Gold Concordat?

Balgruuf: This again?! That was different. Was I given a chance to object to
          the terms of the treaty? No. The Jarls weren't asked. We were told.
          And we had to like it.

Proventus: The chests of gold didn't hurt.

Balgruuf: Dammit! This isn't about gold!

Irileth: It's time to decide.

Proventus: Lord, wait. Let us see if Ulfric is serious.

Balgruuf: Oh, he's serious. But so am I.

Irileth: Finally.

Balgruuf: So about this axe... You can return this axe to our friend. The
          esteemed Jarl of Windhelm has my answer. Make sure he gets it.
          Proventus. Bring me my pen. And the good parchment.

Proventus: Are we writing a letter, Lord?

Balgruuf: Yes, to General Tullius. I need to make a few things clear before I
          accept these Legionnaires of his.

[One returns to Ulfric with the grim tidings.]

Dragonborn: The Jarl of Whiterun returns your axe.

Ulfric: Then I was wrong about him. You were right¹ Galmar.

Galmar: Again?

Ulfric: I'm in no mood to joke.

Galmar: Give the word, my lord, and Whiterun is yours.

Ulfric: Whiterun is only a means to an end.

Galmar: I've toured our camps. We're ready, Ulfric... Whenever you are.

Ulfric: Is a man ever ready to give the orders that will mean the deaths of
        many.¹

Galmar: No. But neither is every man able to give that order when he must. But
        you are that man, Ulfric. You've been that man before, and you'll be
        him again. And these men and women -- they call themselves Stormcloaks
        because they believe in you... They are the meanest, toughest sons of
        bitches Skyrim has to offer. And they want this. They want this as much
        as you do. Perhaps they want it more.

Ulfric: You're certain we're ready? Whiterun's army will no doubt be bolstered
        by Legionnaires. And those walls around Whiterun are old, but they
        still stand.

Galmar: We're ready. And I might be old myself, but I'll kick those damn walls
        down with my bare feet! -- if you would only ask me to do it!

Ulfric: And I'm sure you could do it, too. Alright. This is it.

Galmar: Yes!

Ulfric: Send the word. "A new day is dawning and the sun rises over Whiterun."

Galmar: Aye, and the sons of Skyrim will greet that dawn teeth and swords
        flashing.

Ulfric: So it begins. Make haste to our camp in Whiterun. I want you on the
        front lines. I have a feeling about you. Your place is on that
        battlefield. I need you there.

        Yes, sir!
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Fight well, or die well.

        Many will die by my hand.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Then I commit them to whatever gods they still believe in.

        Talos be with you!

Galmar: We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack.
        Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.

[ST04] BATTLE FOR WHITERUN |===================================================
___________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player travels to the Stormcloaks' catapult-filled camp in Whiterun's
 countryside.]

Galmar: This is it, men!

Ralof: So, do you get that weird taste in your mouth before battle, too? What
       is that?

[They storm the gates, destroying the chevaux-de-frise and approaching the
 main gate. However, the drawbridge is down, forcing the Dragonborn to flank
 the hill and open it manually. This sudden change causes the Whiterun and
 Imperials to garrison inside the town, forcing the battle all the way up to
 Dragonsreach.]

Irileth: Halt in the name of the Jarl, Balgruuf the Greater!

Balgruuf: I'll be damned if I let this rabble take my city without raising my
          own sword.

Irileth: Stay back, lord!

[Soon, the jarl is brought to heel.]

Balgruuf: Enough! That's enough. I surrender...I surrender. Peace! Everyone
          stand down. That's an order. Stand down!

[Hostilities over, a prominent Whiterun citizen enters the castle.]

Vignar Gray-Mane: Balgruuf!

Balgruuf: Vignar Gray-Mane! Your family was noticeably absent from the walls...
          Now I know why. Wouldn't a dagger in the back have sufficed?

Vignar: You think this is personal? The Empire has no place in Skyrim... Not
        any more. And you? You have no place in Whiterun anymore.

Balgruuf: A convenient position to hold now. But mark my words, old man, in
          the days to come, Ulfric will spread his rebellion thin. And what
          then? We need the Empire, as much as it needs us. We Nords are the
          Empire! Our blood built it. Our blood sustains it! You of all people
          should know that.

Vignar: If this was my Empire, I'd be able to worship whoever I damned well
        pleased. You wish to see an Empire without Talos? Without its soul? We
        should be fighting those witch-elves, not bending knee to them. The
        Emperor is nothing more than a puppet of the Thalmor. Skyrim needs a
        High King who will fight for her, and Whiterun needs a Jarl who will
        do the same.

Balgruuf: Tell me, Vignar. Was all this worth it? How many of those corpses
          lining our streets wear the faces of men who once called you friend?
          What about their families?

Galmar: Enough! Both of you! There is a burning city out there that needs a
        government.

Vignar: He's right. Galmar, come, let us restore order.

Balgruuf: This isn't over. You hear me you old fool! This isn't over!

[He turns to the player.]

Balgruuf: And you. A Stormcloak? I'd thought better of you. You'll all come to
          regret this day.

Galmar: Get over to Windhelm. Tell Ulfric of our victory here.

Ralof: I'm pretty sure I killed more than you. I was counting.

[The victory is soon reported to Ulfric.]

Ulfric: We've driven the Imperials out of Whiterun. This is good. Very good.
        We now control the center. It's a powerful position. One I aim to keep.
        We'll call you Ice-Veins now, for the thick blood of our land has
        seeped into your heart. Here, take this. It's an Imperial officer's
        sword. A fitting weapon to use against our enemy.

Dragonborn: What's our next move against the Empire?

Ulfric: I suspect you'll be of greater use to us with greater freedom, so
        you're free to engage the Imperials as you see fit. But I also want you
        to find our hidden camp in Falkreath. Galmar will have special tasks
        for you, and will need you when we liberate the capital.

        What exactly will I be doing out there?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much
         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.

        Understood.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Talos guide you.
         • Go with the gods.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player journeys to Falkreath's camp, set on the Throat of the World's
 southern slope, near the mountain pass.]

Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Galmar: You're going to Fort Neugrad. They have some of our boys locked up
        there. But with a little luck, we can turn that to our advantage. I've
        sent some men to scout the area. Meet them, see if you can't find a way
        to slip in, free our men, and take over the fort. They'll never suspect
        an attack from the inside. This won't be easy. But that's why I'm
        sending you. You got the grit to get this done?

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than
         fight for the people of Skyrim?

        Nothing I can't handle.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • We all have faith in you.
         • Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.

[ST06] LIBERATION OF SKYRIM: RESCUE FROM FORT NEUGRAD |========================
______________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Near the fort, the player finds the ambush party. Ralof is there, too.]

Ralof: Well, well. Look who it is! How have you been?

       I'm all right, I guess. How are you?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Good to hear.

       I've been better. And you?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        These are dark days. But at least we know we're doing our part to make
        things better, eh? I guess I'm doing all right.

       I need this to go well. This is my first real command since they
       promoted me after Whiterun. You know, some nights when I close my eyes,
       I see the battle stretched out before me, like I'm still there... Do the
       men you killed still haunt you? Mine do...

         Only a beast kills without feeling.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I suppose you're right...they say it gets easier... I'm not sure if
          that's a good thing...

         If you hadn't killed them, they would have killed you.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          That's what I keep telling myself.

         But, never mind all that. We've got a job to do.

       So what's the plan? / What's the plan?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Straight to business with you, huh? Well, it just so happens I have
        the perfect mission for you. We found a cave under the lake. With
        luck, it'll lead into the prison. I need you to sneak in there, free
        our men, killing anyone inside as you go. Once you've rescued the
        prisoners, head out to the courtyard. We'll stand guard out here and
        rush in as soon as we hear fighting. Should be fun.

       I'm on it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        • You should wait until night fall¹ before trying to sneak in.

       Talos preserve you.

       I'm not much for sneaking.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I have faith in you.

[Using Ralof's advice, the player uses a sunken cave to infiltrate the prison.
 The four prisoners are being watched by a guard, who's quickly disposed of.]

Stormcloak: The guard has the key.

[The captives are freed. They collect their confiscated gear, then make for
 the courtyard. The pincer attack is successful, ensuring all Imperials are
 gutted and the fort overtaken.]

Ralof: Great work! Get back and report our success. I'll stay here and clean
       up the mess. Glad you were here. Couldn't have done it without you!

[News is brought to Ulfric.]

Ulfric: I'm proud we liberated Falkreath from the Empire. In many ways it's the
        heart and soul of Skyrim. Not to mention its rather strategic position.
        Some brothers have taken to calling you Bone-Breaker, evidence of your
        ferocity and determination. A fitting name. So we shall all call you
        thus. The war demands so much from us, and we give all we have to it
        and the people...but I've kept a little something to offer you in
        appreciation. Please take this on behalf of all the brothers and
        sisters. And I need capable and loyal warriors close at hand. So I'd
        like to offer you a home in Windhelm. Speak with my steward who'll make
        the arrangements.

Dragonborn: What's our next move against the Empire?

Ulfric: Get over to our camp in the Reach. They need every able body they can
        muster.

        What exactly will I be doing out there?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much
         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.

        Understood.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Talos guide you.
         • For Skyrim!

[ST07] LIBERATION OF SKYRIM: COMPELLING TRIBUTE |==============================
________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[One ventures to the hilly Reach camp, northeast of Karthwasten.]

Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Galmar: Get over to Markarth. Rumor has it the Jarl's steward, Raerek, is a
        faithful Talos worshipper, if not a true son of Skyrim -- he still
        supports the Empire, after all. But, if confronted with proof of his
        belief, you might be able to "persuade" him to aid our cause,
        indirectly of course. Wouldn't want to sully his reputation, would we?
        You'll need to be careful with this one. The Jarl's men won't look
        kindly on you rummaging through the steward's quarters.

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than
         fight for the people of Skyrim?

        I'll get proof...and Raerek's cooperation.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I can always count on you, can't I?

[One ventures to Understone Keep in Markarth, and finds Raerek's inscribed
 Amulet of Talos in his nightstand. He's immediately confronted with it.]

Dragonborn: Recognize this? (Show him Raerek's Inscribed Amulet of Talos)

Raerek: Not here. Come with me. Stay close and the guards will leave you alone.

[He leads the player into his chambers.]

Raerek: I suppose you're here to extort something from me? Is that it? Well,
        what is it you want?

        If you believe in Talos, why don't you join our cause?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         So. You're one of Ulfric's spies... I can't deny the man is right
         about a few things... But I've seen first hand what Ulfric is capable
         of, given the chance. Suffice it to say, he is no friend of Markarth,
         and no friend of mine. My first and only loyalties are to my nephew,
         and to this city.

        What if this were made public?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The Thalmor would need to make an example of me...I'd be thrown into
         prison, but our family's honor would be stained for generations. I'm
         the Jarl's uncle. He, his father, and I, swore oaths to the Empire to
         abandon Talos, as conditions of our return to the city.

Dragonborn: Perhaps we could come to some kind of agreement?

Raerek: What if I told you about a large shipment of silver and weapons?

        Go on. I'm listening.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, no. I won't tell you anything more until we have an agreement.

         And what about something for me, right now? (Persuade)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Well I...I suppose I'm not left much choice in the matter, am I? Very
          well. I trust a hefty purse of septims will suffice?

        How much are we talking about?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Enough to make a significant difference in the war.

        All right, it's a deal. Where can I find this shipment?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         They're taking it by wagon to Solitude. If you hurry, you'll catch
         them before they get far. It'll be a fairly slow moving¹ caravan. The
         shipment is quite heavy, and guarded by many men.

        Now, let's pretend we never had this discussion.

[The news is delivered to one's superior.] 

Dragonborn: Raerek says there's a shipment of coin traveling to Solitude...

Galmar: Good job. I knew you'd come back with something for me. It just so
        happens, I've got some scouts along the road. Meet up with them, and
        together see if you can't overpower the caravan.

[Ralof is found once again at the meeting spot.]

Ralof: Hey there! I was wondering when I'd run into you out here. The Reach is
       a beautiful but dangerous place, eh? One false step and you'll fall to
       your death, that is if those Forsworn don't get you first. Have you
       seen those Briarheart men? That's some evil magic right there. What
       brings you? You have the look of purpose in your eyes.

Dragonborn: There's an enemy wagon loaded with coin and weapons. We need to
            capture it.

Ralof: Really? It just so happens we've been tracking a wagon! For about a day
       now. So that's what's in there? Coins and weapons? How do you know
       that?

       I blackmailed Raerek for the information.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That was crafty. I'm sure having a steward in the pocket will come in
        handy. Lucky for us, that the wagon recently had a little accident.
        They're stranded now. Just up the road! 

       It doesn't matter.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Oh, fine. Keep your secrets. I see how it is. That wagon recently had
        a little accident. They're stranded now, just up the road.
        
       We're outnumbered, but I have a plan. You got here just in time.

Dragonborn: What's the plan?

Ralof: First, we're going to take out their sentry, then we'll situate
       ourselves overlooking the camp. Next, you'll infiltrate their position
       and get their attention while we hit them with a barrage of arrows. With
       a bit of luck, we'll catch them completely off guard and even the odds a
       little.

       I have a better plan. You wait here, and I'll take care of it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        All right, if you insist. But we'll come running if it sounds like
        things have gotten out of hand.

       Let's wait a little longer.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Let me know when you're ready.

       Ready. Let's go.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Good.

[They sneak forward toward the sentry.]

Ralof: There's a sentry patrolling the hill. We'll go in quiet and drop him
       with a combined arrow barrage. Keep low, fire on my word. Fire!

[They silently slay the watchman.]

Ralof: All right. You infiltrate their camp, we'll cover you from the ridge.
       Good luck!

[The Imperial stooges are mopped up.]

Ralof: We make quite a team, eh? I'll stay here and guard the shipment. You
       get back to camp with news. Have them send some men -- and a new wagon.
       This one isn't going anywhere.

[Galmar is notified.]

Galmar: Well done! I'll send men with a wagon to collect our prize. We'll put
        the weapons to use here, and I'll send the coin back to Windhelm.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Galmar: You're going to Fort Sungard. Meet the brothers preparing for the
        attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail
        we will garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than
         fight for the people of Skyrim?

        That fort is as good as ours.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.

[It's off to the fort, set atop a ridge and heavily fortified. Despite the
 odds, the troopers are massacred, establishing a foothold for the 'Cloaks.
 The player reports to Ulfric.]

Ulfric: Now that the Empire has been driven from the Reach we can put a stop
        to the raping of her silver mines. That silver belongs to Skyrim.
        Multitudes of our enemies are buried in an avalanche of pain and
        retribution delivered by your hands. I shall call you Snow-Hammer
        now. You show great passion for battle, and compassion for those we
        fight for. You are becoming indispensable to our cause. We do what we
        do out of love for our brothers and sisters. Here, take this as a token
        of such love reciprocated.

Dragonborn: What's next?

Ulfric: You're needed in Hjaalmarch. There's much to be done.

        What exactly will I be doing out there?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You'll be doing whatever Galmar tells you to do, and causing as much
         mayhem as possible for the Empire and any Jarl who supports them.

        Understood.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • For Skyrim!
         • Talos guide you.

[One visits the Hjaalmarch camp, in the marshes near Solitude Inlet. Galmar,
 as usual, is there to dole out missions.]

Dragonborn: Reporting for duty.

Galmar: Need you to deliver some false orders to the Imperial Legate in
        Morthal. But first we need to get our hands on some Imperial orders to
        make the forgeries. The inns at Dragonbridge¹ and Rorikstead are
        frequent stops for Imperial runners. See if you can't "convince" one of
        those innkeepers to help you. One way or another, get me those
        documents. What do you say?

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than
         fight for the people of Skyrim?

        That fort is as good as ours.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Don't screw this up.
         • Excellent. Put the fear of the Nine into those motherless dogs.

[If one goes to Dragon Bridge or Rorikstead, the innkeeper is Faida or Mralki,
 respectively. They have the same responses; in fact, these are also the same
 responses seen in the Imperials' version of the quest.]

Mralki: I tend to keep my patrons' privacy.

        His life is in danger. (Persuade)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • It is? Well that's different.
         • Yeah, sure it is. You don't fool me.

        Maybe some gold will help (### gold)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Well, if you insist...
         • Seems your purse is lighter than you thought.

        I don't have time for this. I can get rough with you if I have to.
        (Intimidate) |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Now, now! That won't be necessary.

        Never mind.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Hmph.

        He was here, but he left. If you leave now, you can probably catch
        him. Or, you can just wait here. He'll be back soon enough.

[Eventually, one tracks down the Imperial deliveryman.]

Courier: Can't stop to chat, citizen.

         I'm not here to talk. I'm here for those documents.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Is that so?

         Never mind.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Hmph.

[The parcel is taken, one way or another, to Galmar.]

Galmar: Good work! Let's see what you got. Hmm... They know more of our plans
        than I thought... Not good... Oh, what's this? Fort Snowhawk is in need
        of reinforcements... We'll make sure they won't be getting those...
        Give me a moment while I make a few, um, "corrections" to these
        reports... There we go. Make sure those forged documents get to the
        Legate in Morthal. That should give them the wrong idea...and us the
        advantage.

[One seeks out Taurinus Duilis in the swampy village.]

Dragonborn: I have important documents for you, sir.

Duilis: • Is that so? Lost your uniform along the way did you, soldier?

          Dragonborn: Ditched it for this. Easier to sneak past the enemy.

          I suppose it would be. Good thinking.

        Thank you, soldier. Let's take a look at these reports... I'm waiting
        on word about reinforcements for the fort... Good, they're on the way.
        And we have some information on enemy troop movements. Excellent.
        Stormcloak scouts are making it difficult to move around. It's good
        you made it here in one piece. Why don't you have yourself a drink at
        the Moorside before you head back?

[Galmar is notified of the subterfuge.]

Galmar: Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!

Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Galmar: You're going to Fort Snowhawk. Meet the brothers preparing for the
        attack. Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail
        we will garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Well, make it quick, or do you have better things to do than
         fight for the people of Skyrim?

        That fort is as good as ours.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.

[One visits Snowhawk, set in the mountain west of Morthal. It's a wonder who
 got the wrong report: there's still many men garrisoned, making man to cut
 through before victory's at hand. Afterward, it's time to notify Ulfric.]

Ulfric: Tullius must be getting nervous. Taking Hjaalmarch we're practically
        in his backyard now. As soon as we're able, we'll march on Solitude.
        You've become a true hero of Skyrim. I number you among my kin. You
        shall now be known as Stormblade. The love of the land and her people
        flows from your heart, even as death to her enemies flows from your
        hands. On behalf of the sons and daughters of Skyrim, on behalf of all
        that is righteous and true, take this token of our appreciation for
        your service.

Dragonborn: What's next?

Ulfric: You've no time to glory in your accomplishments. We're gathering for
        our final assault on Solitude. I need you there. Report to our camp in
        Haafingar.

[One goes to the base, situated between Solitude and Dragon Bridge.]

Dragonborn: Reporting in.

Galmar: You're going to the fort. Meet the brothers preparing for the attack.
        Then join them in wiping out the Imperials. Once you prevail we will
        garrison the fort. What do you say? Can you do this?

        I'm not sure. I need to think about it.

         Good. You've got real fire in you. I like that... Talos guide you.

[One visits the snowy fort, nestled on the northern face of the mountains
 near Solitude, overlooking the sea. After the hard-fought victory, it's back
 to Galmar.]

Galmar: Good job! Ulfric was right about you. I'm glad to have you with us!

Dragonborn: How can I help?

Galmar: We're taking the city. Meet the brothers gathering for the attack.
        Fight well or die well. Talos be with you.

[ST13] LIBERATION OF SKYRIM: BATTLE FOR SOLITUDE |=============================
_________________________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[At long last, it's time to fight at the seat of Tullius' leadership. Ulfric
 himself is leading the charge at the city's gates.]

Ulfric: This is it men! Time to make this city ours! We come to this moment
        carried by the sacrifice and courage of our fellows! Those who have
        fallen. And those still bearing shields to our right. On this day, our
        enemy will know the fullness of our determination, the true depth of
        our anger, and the exalted righteousness of our cause. The gods are
        watching. The spirits of our ancestors are stirring. And men under suns
        yet to dawn will be transformed by what we do here today. Fear neither
        pain, nor darkness. For Sovngarde awaits those who die with weapons in
        their hands, and courage in their hearts. We now fight our way to
        Castle Dour to cut the head off the Legion itself! And in that moment,
        the gods will look down and see Skyrim as she was meant to be. Full of
        Nords who are mighty, powerful, and free! Ready now! Everyone, with me!
        For the sons and daughters of Skyrim! Rrrrrraaaaaaaaaggggghhhhhhh!!!!!!

[The Stormcloak army filters into the city, bringing the bloodletting to the
 streets in quick fashion. The shortest route is now gated, forcing the battle
 up and around into the courtyard. Eventually, the castle is infiltrated, with
 the jarl and Galmar in tow. Rikke and Tullius are in the strategy room.]
 
Ulfric: Secure the door.

Galmar: Already done.

[The player can speak to Rikke before anything else happens.]

Rikke: Dragonborn... Perhaps this is the fate of Skyrim after all. To be
       destroyed from the inside.

       We'll kill you if we must.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        A true Nord never fears death. It's the how and why of it one needs
        consider.

       Rikke, leave. They'll kill you.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        If that must be, then it will. And why should I be any different? So
        many lives have already been lost. What's one more?

[The Jarl will soon approach Tullius and his aide-de-camp.]

Rikke: Ulfric. Stop.

Ulfric: Stop what? Taking Skyrim back from those who'd leave her to rot?

Rikke: You're wrong. Ulfric. We need the Empire. Without it Skyrim will
       assuredly fall to the Dominion.

Galmar: You were there with us. You saw it. The day the Empire signed that
        damn treaty was the day the Empire died.

Rikke: You're a damn fool.

Galmar: Stand aside woman. We've come for the General.

Rikke: He has given up. But I have not.

Ulfric: Rikke. Go. You're free to leave.

Rikke: I'm also free to stay and fight for what I believe in.

Ulfric: You're also free to die for it.

Rikke: This is what you wanted? Shield brothers and sisters killing each other?
       Families torn apart? This is the Skyrim you want?!

Galmar: Damnit woman, stand aside!

Rikke: That's not the Skyrim I want to live in.

Ulfric: Rikke. You don't have to do this.

Rikke: You've left me no choice... Talos preserve us.

[The fighting is brief, but ends with Rikke dead and Tullius gravely wounded.]

Tullius: Enough...enough...

Ulfric: This is it for you. Any last words before I send you to Oblivion?

Tullius: You realize this is exactly what they wanted.

Galmar: What who wanted?

Tullius: The Thalmor. They stirred up trouble here. Forced us to divert needed
         resources and throw away good soldiers quelling this rebellion.

Ulfric: It's a little more than a rebellion, don't you think?

Galmar: Heh.

Tullius: We aren't the bad guys you know.

Ulfric: Maybe not, but you certainly aren't the good guys.

Tullius: Perhaps you're right. But then what does that make you?

Ulfric: You said it yourself.

Galmar: It makes us right.

Tullius: And if I surrender?

Ulfric: The Empire I remember never surrendered.

Galmar: That Empire is dead. And so are you.

Tullius: So be it.

Galmar: Just kill him and let's be done with it already.

Ulfric: Come, Galmar. Where's your sense of the dramatic moment?

Galmar: By the gods! If it's a good ending to some damn story you're after --
        perhaps the Dragonborn should be the one to do it.

Ulfric: Good point. Well, Dragonborn. What do you say? Do you want the honor?

        I've had my fair share of killing today.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         As you wish.

        That honor belongs to you.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         As you wish. This moment, we three, will be immortalized in song.

        I'll gladly kill him.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Dragonborn. Here, use my sword to do it. This moment will be
         immortalized in song. Make it a good kill.
         
[One way or another, Tullius is put to the sword.]

Tullius: Aghh..¹

Galmar: Good. It's done.

Ulfric: Well, I suppose some kind of speech is in order.

Galmar: I'll go gather the men in the courtyard.

Ulfric: And Elisif?

Galmar: Don't you worry about her. I've sent my best men to round her up.

Ulfric: Stormblade. I want you to have my sword, a token of my appreciation.
        Now then. The men will expect a speech. Will you stand by my side? I
        wish to honor you, Dragonborn and the truest of Stormcloaks.

        Of course, my Lord.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Very good. Come, the people await us.

        Maybe you should leave me out of your speech.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, why is that?

         Many have fought and died. I'm no different than they are.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          On the contrary, you exceed the rest. But, I will honor your request.
          The gods will know of your victories, and they themselves will glory
          in your deeds. Come, at the very least walk out with me.

         I'm not sure this was all worth it, after all.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          There's no shame in such thoughts. A man without doubts is a man
          without a conscience. But rest assured. We've won Skyrim's right to
          determine her own future. And for that, every Nord praises us. But
          I will heed your wishes. Come, at the very least, walk out with me.

         My reasons are my own.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          A man's heart is his own burden to bear, so I will honor your
          request, though it casts a bit of gloom on an otherwise glorious
          day. Come, at the very least walk out with me.

[Outside, the Stormcloak throngs are massing for the speech. Elisif the Fair,
 the region's jarl, is in attendance with Galmar's bodyguards.]

Ulfric: I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as
        Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn. And indeed, there
        are many that call us heroes.

Ulfric: • I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak... And indeed, there are many that call
          me hero.

        • I am indeed Ulfric Stormcloak, and at my side the man we know as
          Stormblade, and the world knows as the Dragonborn. And indeed, there
          are many that call us heroes.

        But it is all of you who are the true heroes! It was you who fought a
        dying Empire who sunk its claws into our land, trying to drag us down
        with it. It was you who fought the Thalmor and their puppets who would
        have us deny our gods and our heritage. It was you who fought your kin
        who didn't understand our cause, who weren't willing to pay the price
        of our freedom. But more than that, it was you who fought for Skyrim,
        for our right to fight our own battles... To return to our glory and
        our traditions, to determine our own future! And it is for these
        reasons that I cannot accept the mantle of "High King." Not until the
        Moot declares that title should adorn my shoulders will I accept it.

Stormcloak: What about Jarl Elisif?

Ulfric: Yes, what about the Lady Elisif? Will she put aside her personal hatred
        for me, and her misplaced love for the Emperor and his coin, so that
        the suffering of our people will end? Will she acknowledge that it is
        we Nord's¹ who will determine Skyrim's future? Will she swear fealty to
        me, so all may know we are at peace, and a new day has dawned?

Elisif: I do!

Ulfric: Then it is settled. The Jarl will continue to rule in Solitude, I will
        garrison armies here to ward off Imperial attempts to reclaim the city.
        And in due time, the Moot will meet, and settle the claim to High King
        once and for all. There is much to do, and I need every able bodied¹
        man and woman committed to rebuilding Skyrim. A great darkness is
        growing, and soon we will be called to fight it, on these shores or
        abroad. The Aldmeri Dominion may have defeated the Empire, but it has
        not defeated Skyrim!

Stormcloaks: Yyyyyyyaaaaaahhhhhh!

Ulfric: How'd I do?

Galmar: Eh, not so bad. Nice touch about the High King.

Ulfric: Thank you, I thought so, too.

Galmar: It's a foregone conclusion, you know.

Ulfric: Oh, I know.

Galmar: The Imperials aren't going to leave us alone. They still have camps in
        the hills. They'll continue to strike out at us, whenever and wherever
        they are.

Ulfric: I'm not afraid of the remnants of the Legion, in time they'll all give
        up and go home. What I fear, is the Thalmor will see our victory here
        and turn greater attention to our shores. We must be prepared to face
        them.

Galmar: Aye.

[He turns to the player.]

Ulfric: And, of course, we couldn't have done it without you. May the gods
        preserve you.

Galmar: May the gods preserve us all.

Ulfric: Come, Galmar. We've still much work to do.

[Ulfric can be asked about the future, now that the questline's over.]

Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do to help the cause?

Ulfric: True sons and daughters of Skyrim reign in every city, we've crippled
        the Imperial Legion, and cut off its head by killing General Tullius
        himself. What more could I ask of you? No, you're free to roam. I
        suspect the gods have needs for you elsewhere. That said, some of the
        Legion's staunchest men have organized themselves, and are operating
        out of hidden military camps in the wilderness. If you come across any
        Imperials in your travels, I expect you'll know what to do.

Dragonborn: So, do I call you High King now?

Ulfric: No, not yet. We'll wait for the Moot to name me High King. It'll be
        better for all that way. But, that doesn't mean I won't start acting
        like it. There's much to do. The new Jarls need help building armies,
        and enforcing their right to rule. The Empire may try to reclaim
        Skyrim, and I need everyone ready for that. Though the biggest threat,
        of course, is the elves.

Dragonborn: Now that we've defeated the Imperials, will there be peace?

Ulfric: There will be peace for a time, during which we must rebuild Skyrim
        into the land it once was. Strong. Self-reliant. The center of mankind.
        Because getting rid of the Empire was only half the problem. Soon, the
        elves will again seek to rule the world. We must ready ourselves to
        fight them. For it will be Skyrim that shall lead Tamriel in those
        dark days, when the fate of the world is finally determined.

[Galmar can also be spoken to.]

Dragonborn: Is there anything further I can do for the cause?

Galmar: No. I trust you'll do more good out there in the world, wherever you
        damn well please to go. You're a true son of Skyrim. You'll know what
        to do. To begin with, killing any Legionnaire you find out in the
        wilderness. I've reports they've hidden military camps out there.

Dragonborn: What's next for the mighty Galmar Stone-Fist?

Galmar: Heh. Ulfric's put me in charge of keeping an eye on the new Jarls. You
        know, make sure they're generally following orders. Can't say I'm
        looking forward to that. But, I'll also be training men and women for
        their new armies. The Empire might send over a few Legionnaires to make
        sure we're serious, and of course, we'll be taking the fight to the
        elves soon enough. We'll need trained, disciplined and creative
        warriors ready for all that.

[Elisif can be spoken to as well.]

Dragonborn: What do you think about Ulfric, now that he has won?

Elisif: Ulfric coveted the High King's throne. He thought he deserved it more
        than Torygg. Now it would seem Ulfric has his wish. And there truly is
        no justice in the world.

Dragonborn: So, do you still claim to be High Queen of Skyrim?

Elisif: No. Although it's true my husband Torygg was the High King and I am his
        widow, I am in no position to claim such a title. Ulfric Stormcloak is
        victorious, and the Jarls have fallen in line. It seems I will never
        take my rightful place as High Queen.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 [While walking in Riften, a man approaches in the marketplace. It's the same
 bunko artist trying to hawk "genuine Falmerblood elixirs" to unsuspecting
 travelers.]

Brynjolf: Never done an honest day's work in your life for all that coin you're
          carrying, eh, lad?

Dragonborn: I'm sorry, what?

Brynjolf: I'm saying you've got the coin, but you didn't earn a septim of it
          honestly. I can tell.

          How could you possibly know that?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           It's all about sizing up your mark, lad. The way they walk, what
           they're wearing. It's a dead giveaway.7

          My wealth is none of your business.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Oh, but that's where you're wrong, lad. Wealth is my business. Maybe
           you'd like a taste?

Dragonborn: What do you have in mind?

Brynjolf: I've got a bit of an errand to perform, but I need an extra pair of
          hands. And in my line of work, extra hands are well-paid.

Dragonborn: What do I have to do?

Brynjolf: Simple...I'm going to cause a distraction, and you're going to steal
          Madesi's silver ring from a strongbox under his stand. Once you
          have it, I want you to place it in Brand-Shei's pocket without him
          noticing.

          Why plant the ring on Brand-Shei?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           There's someone that wants to see him put out of business
           permanently. That's all you need to know. Now, you tell me when
           you're ready and we'll get started.

            I'm ready. Let's get this started.
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Good. Wait until I start the distraction, then show me what you're
             made of.

            Why are we doing this to Brand-Shei?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             We've been contracted to make Brand-Shei remembers not to meddle
             in affairs that are not his own. Now, since we're not the Dark
             Brotherhood, we're not going to kill him; we're just going to
             make sure he sits in the prisons for a few days.

            How am I supposed to do all of this?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Do you want me to hold your hand as well? You're going to have to
             sneak over to Madesi's stall and use your lockpick on the
             strongbox. Then, when you have the ring, you pickpocket Brand-Shei
             and leave it behind.

          Break the law? Are you kidding?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Sorry...I usually have a nose for this kind of thing. Never mind
           then, lad. If you change your mind, come find me.

[With help recruited, Brynjolf begins his scam, getting other vendors to come
 see what he's hawking.]

Brynjolf: Everyone! Everyone! Gather 'round! I have something amazing to show
          you that demands your attention! This way, everyone! Over here! No
          pushing, no shoving. Plenty of room!

Brand-Shei: Come on, Brynjolf...what is it this time?

Brynjolf: Patience, Brand-Shei. This is a rare opportunity, and I wouldn't want
          you to get left out.

Madesi: That's what you said about the Wisp Essence and it turned out to be
        crushed Nirnroot mixed with water!

Brynjolf: Well, that was a simple misunderstanding, but this item is the real
          thing. Lads and lasses, I give you, Falmerblood Elixir!

Brand-Shei: Oh, come on, are you talking about the Snow Elves?

Brynjolf: The one and only. Mystical beings who live in legends and were
          masters of great magic. Imagine the power that coursed through their
          veins!

Madesi: How did you get that then? No one's seen them in years!

Brynjolf: My sources must remain a secret for their own protection, but I can
          promise you that the contents are genuine. One sip of the elixir and
          your wishes will be granted. Great wealth, everlasting life or
          perhaps limitless power could be yours!

Brand-Shei: How much does it cost?

Brynjolf: Only twenty gold septims. Hurry before my supply is gone!

Madesi: Why would you even listen to him?

Brynjolf: Only twenty septims a bottle!

Brand-Shei: I can't afford to get one, but can I afford not to?

[The player steals Madesi's ring and reverse-pickpockets it without a hitch.]

Brynjolf: Well, I see that my time is up. Come back tomorrow if you wish to
          buy.

Madesi: What a waste of time.

Brand-Shei: Damn. I knew I shouldn't have waited.

[As the crowd disperses, Brynjolf seeks the player out.]

Brynjolf: Looks like I chose the right person for the job. And here you go...
          your payment, as promised. The way things have been going around
          here, it's a relief that our plan went off without a hitch.

Dragonborn: What's been going on?

Brynjolf: Bah. My organization's been having a run of bad luck, but I suppose
          that's just how it goes. But never mind that, you did the job and you
          did it well. Best of all, there's more where that came from...if you
          think you can handle it.

          I can handle it.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Alright, then. Let's put that to the test. The group I represent has
           its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged
           Flagon. Get there in one piece and we'll see if you really have what
           it takes.

          The money's nice, but I don't know.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Look, I'll make this simple for you. The group I represent has its
           home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern called the Ragged
           Flagon. When you make up your mind, come find me there and we can
           talk about your future.

          No way. It was wrong to do those things.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Arrogant, eh? Play it however you want, but listen up. The group I
           represent has its home in the Ratway beneath Riften...a tavern
           called the Ragged Flagon. When you come to your senses, find me
           there and we'll discuss your future.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Defeating the foes in the Ratway, the player reaches the hidden tavern 'neath
 the city. Brynjolf and some of his cohorts are discussing the player.]

Vekel the Man: Give it up, Brynjolf...those days are over.

Brynjolf: I'm telling you, this one is different...

Dirge: We've all hear that one before, Bryn! Quit kidding yourself.

Vekel the Man: It's time to face the truth, old friend. You, Vex, Mercer...
               you're all part of a dying breed. Things are changing!

Brynjolf: Dying breed, eh? Well what do you call that then?

Brynjolf: Well, well...color me impressed, lad. I wasn't sure I'd ever see you
          again!

          Getting here was easy.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Reliable and headstrong? You're turning out to be quite the prize!
           So...now that I've whetted your appetite with our little scheme at
           the market, how about handling a few deadbeats for me?

          I almost got killed!
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           No risk, no reward. That's the way it goes, so you better get used
           to it. Now, if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about
           handling a few deadbeats for me?

          Don't know why I bothered. This place is a mess.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           If you were expecting a palace, then maybe you're not cut out for
           this line of work. Our methods require secrecy and discretion. Now,
           if you're done bellyaching like a child, how about handling a few
           deadbeats for me?

Dragonborn: Deadbeats? What'd they do?

Brynjolf: They owe our organization some serious coin and they've decided not
          to pay. I want you to explain to them the error of their ways.

Dragonborn: Sounds good. Who are they?

Brynjolf: Keerava, Bersi Honey-Hand and Haelga. Do this right and I can promise
          you a permanent place in our organization.

Dragonborn: How do you want me to handle it?

Brynjolf: Honestly, the debt is secondary here. What's more important is you
          get the message across that we aren't to be ignored. A word of
          warning, though...I don't want any of them killed. Bad for business.

          Consider it done.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Good. If you need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get

          Will I get a cut?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Of course you'll get a cut. We take care of our own. Now, if you
           need any details on your marks, I'll be here. Get going.

          What's Haelga's story?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Haelga is a devout follower of Dibella and dotes over the statue
           to the Divine which she keeps at the Bunkhouse. Use it as leverage
           and she'll cave.

          Any tips about Keerava?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Keerava's stubborn, but she's got a soft spot for her family. Talk
           to Talen-Jei at the Bee and Barb and see if you can get something
           out of him. They're...well-acquainted, if you catch my meaning.

          Any help with Bersi?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           He's as pig-headed a man as you'll ever find. The key is that ugly
           dwarven urn in his shop. Smash that thing to bits and he'll change
           his attitude.

[The player goes to see Bersi Honey-Hand at his pawn shop.]

Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.

Bersi: Wha...what? Oh, it's one of you people. So, Brynjolf doesn't even bother
       to show up himself anymore, eh? What's this message?

       Simple. You don't pay, bad things happen.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Petty threats and fist-waving are not going to sway me. You people are
        all talk and everyone knows it!

        We can protect ourselves. Trust me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Don't fool yourself. It's only a matter of time before you people are
         run out of Riften.

       I think you know what it is.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        You're gouging me for what little coin I make and you can't even
        protect yourselves? Ridiculous!

        We can protect ourselves. Trust me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         (same as above)

       I've had enough of this.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Likewise. Now, I have a lot to do, so I'm afraid you'll just have to
        leave!

       I think you need to shut your mouth. (Brawl)
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I'm going to make you sorry for this!

[If Bersi is beaten up:]

Bersi: Please, no more! I'll pay, I'll pay! Here.

[If the urn is destroyed.]

Bersi: Stop! That's priceless!

Drifa: Oh my word!

Bersi: No! That urn was priceless!

Dragonborn: You want me to break anything else?

Bersi: All right! I get it. I'll pay on time from now on. Just don't smash
       anything else. Here! Take your gold and leave me in peace.

[If the urn is destroyed before speaking to Bersi:]

Bersi: I can't believe you're doing this! Stop! No! That urn was priceless!

Dragonborn: That was from Brynjolf. Get the message?

Bersi: I can't believe you did that! You people are monsters! You demand
       payment for protection and you can't even protect yourselves! Here, take
       your coin and tell Brynjolf to leave us alone.

[If Bersi is the last of the three left, he'll already be intimidated:]

Bersi: Oh no! You're the one from Brynjolf's outfit, aren't you?

Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.

Bersi: Oh! There's no need for that. I know why you're here. Tell Brynjolf not
       to worry about it anymore. Oh! And look, I even have the payment I owed.
       Here, take it.

[The player goes to Haelga's bunkhouse.]

Dragonborn: I have a message for Brynjolf.

Haelga: What does he want now? I already explained to him that you can't get
        blood from a stone.

        This isn't about the money anymore.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Look, I can't make the coin appear out of thin air. Please, be
         reasonable. I'll...I'll pay next month.

         We've run out of patience.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          And so have I. What's the point of paying anyway? Your outfit can't
          even fend for itself. I could do better tossing the gold into the
          sewer. You can't scare me with your tough talk. I'm not paying you a
          single coin.

        Then you'll pay in more than just coin. (Brawl)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ha! We'll see about that.

[If Haelga is beaten up:]

Haelga: Here...take your damn coin and get out of here!

[If her Dibella statue is taken.]

Haelga: Please! Don't take the statue! It's the only thing of value I have
        left!

        I have a message from Brynjolf.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You...you have my statue! What are you going to do with it?

        So, should I drop this statue down a well?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Not Lady Dibella! No, please! I can't lose her! I get the message.
         Here, take your gold. I hope you choke on it!

[If Haelga is the last of the three, she'll already be intimidated.]

Haelga: It's you! Please, don't hurt me!

Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.

Haelga: I know who you are. You've been terrorizing the entire city. Please,
        there's no need for that here. Message understood. Here, I even have
        the payment!

[The player goes to shakedown Keerava, an Argonian at the bar.]

Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.

Keerava: I've already told that buffoon I'm not paying you people a single
         coin!

Dragonborn: It was never a request.

Keerava: Look around you, I'm barely keeping this rathole together. The war's
         seen to that.

         I'm finished wasting my time talking to you.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Good, and take this little message back to your bosses: I'm not
          paying any of you a single septim...ever! Now get out of my inn!

         Don't say I didn't warn you.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Come on, give it your best shot!

[If Keerava is beaten up:]

Keerava: Please, stop! I'll pay up! Take it.

[If one learns about Keerava's family from Talen-Jei, another Argonian:]

Dragonborn: Are you ready to pay Brynjolf what you owe?

Keerava: No, and I never will. Now get out of my inn.

Dragonborn: Maybe I should visit that farm in Morrowind...

Keerava: How could you possibly know about... Please. My family means too much
         to me. Don't hurt them.

Dragonborn: Then pay up and I'll forget about it.

Keerava: Very well. Here. Take this back to Brynjolf and tell him he'll have
         no more trouble from me.

[If Keerava is the last of the three, she'll already be intimidated.]

Dragonborn: I have a message from Brynjolf.

Keerava: Look, everything was all just a misunderstanding. I didn't mean to
         tell Brynjolf to go jump off the pier. You'll tell him I'm sorry, yes?
         Take this. Every single coin I owe is there, I swear.

[With all three merchants shaken down, the player returns to Ragged Flagon.]

Brynjolf: So, job's done and you even brought the gold. Best of all, you did it
          clean. I like that. Dumping bodies and keeping the guards quiet can
          be expensive.

Dragonborn: Here's what they owed us.

Brynjolf: Well done. And it would seem I owe you something in return. Here you
          go, I think you'll find these quite useful.

[He gives some potions as recompense.]

Dragonborn: What's next, then?

Brynjolf: Judging from how well you've handled those shopkeepers, I'd say
          you've done more than simply prove yourself. We need people like you
          in our outfit.

Dragonborn: If there's more gold where that came from, I'm in.

Brynjolf: That's the spirit! Larceny's in your blood...the telltale sign of a
          practiced thief. I think you'll do more than just fit in around here.

Dragonborn: Before we go, I have to ask...

Brynjolf: What's on your mind?

Dragonborn: Word is your outfit isn't doing well. True?

Brynjolf: We've run into a rough patch lately, but it's nothing to be concerned
          about. Tell you what: you keep making us coin and I'll worry about
          everything else. Fair enough?

Dragonborn: Fair enough.

Brynjolf: Now if there are no more questions, how about following me and I'll
          show you what you're all about.

[Brynjolf leads the player through a hidden door into the Thieves Guild's real
 domain, a cistern beyond the Ragged Flagon. The guildmaster is waiting.]

Brynjolf: Mercer? This is the one I was talking about...our new recruit.

Mercer Frey: This better not be another waste of the Guild's resources,
             Brynjolf. Before we continue, I want to make one thing perfectly
             clear. If you play by the rules, you walk away rich. You break
             the rules and you lose your share. No debates, no discussions...
             you do what we say, when we say. Do I make myself clear?

             Yes, I understand.
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              Good. Then I think it's time we put your expertise to the test.

             I'm not sure.
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              If you're not sure maybe you don't belong here. I'll ask again,
              are we clear on all of this?

             Rules? We're thieves. What's the point of rules?
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              I'll let that comment go because you're new here. Ask things out
              of turn again, and we have a problem. Now, are we clear on all
              of this?

Brynjolf: Wait a moment... You're not talking about Goldenglow, are you? Even
          our little Vex couldn't get in.

Mercer: You claim this recruit possesses an aptitude for our line of work. If
        so, let him prove it. Goldenglow Estate is critically important to one
        of our largest clients. However, the owner has suddenly decided to take
        matters into his own hands, and shut us out. He needs to be taught a
        lesson. Brynjolf will provide you with the details.

Brynjolf: Mercer, aren't you forgetting something?

Mercer: Hmm? Oh, yes... Since Brynjolf assures me you'll be nothing but a
        benefit to us, then you're in. Welcome to the Thieves Guild.

[Mercer walks off.]

Brynjolf: Welcome to the family, lad. I'm expecting you to make us a lot of
          coin, so don't disappoint me.

Dragonborn: So how do I get my cut of the spoils?

Brynjolf: Simple. Do as you're told and keep your blade clean. We can't turn a
          profit by killing. You should talk with Delvin Mallory and Vex. They
          know their way around this place and they'll be able to kick some
          extra jobs your way. Oh, and talk to Tonilia in the Flagon...she'll
          set you up with your new armor.

Dragonborn: Tell me about the Goldenglow job.

Brynjolf: Goldenglow Estate is a bee farm; they raise the wretched little
          things for honey. It's run by some smart-mouth wood elf named
          Aringoth. We need you to teach him a lesson by burning down three of
          his estate's hives

Dragonborn: What's the catch?

Brynjolf: The catch is that you can't burn the whole place to the ground. That
          important client Mercer mentioned would be furious if you did.

          Who cares, we're the Thieves Guild.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           That's not how things work around here. The Guild depends on an
           arrangement of influential people to keep things running smoothly.
           Without them at our backs, we'd be in serious trouble.

          Makes sense.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Aye, the last thing we want to be doing is crossing our clients.
           
          What's so important about these clients?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           The guild depends on an arrangement of influential people to keep
           things running smoothly. Without them at our backs, we'd be in
           serious trouble.

Dragonborn: What should I do about Aringoth?

Brynjolf: Maven prefers that Aringoth remains alive, but if he tries to stop
          you from getting the job done, kill him. The Guild has a lot riding
          on this. Don't make me look foolish by mucking it up.

          I need more details about Goldenglow.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Goldenglow Estate brought in a mountain of gold for the Guild. You
           could almost call it our sweetest deal. Then out of the clear blue,
           Aringoth stops sending us our cut. Mercer was...well, angry, to put
           it kindly. So we send in Vex to find out he's hired a bunch of
           mercenaries to guard the place.

            Mercenaries? Not Riften guards?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Aye. Aringoth sent the city guard packing and fortified the entire
             island. In fact, Vex barely made it out of there alive. You should
             talk to her about it before you go.

          How do I destroy the bee hives?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           They're built like small fortresses to resist the weather, but their
           one weakness is flame. Besides, nothing tells the people of Riften
           we mean business than a huge column of smoke.

            Why not level the entire estate?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            I'll give you one good reason: Maven Black-Briar. Burn all the
            hives and she'd have to import for Black-Briar Meadery, which would
            cut into her profits.

             Maven Black-Briar is the influential client?
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              We had an arrangement with Maven. We kept an eye on Goldenglow
              Estate to make sure the honey kept flowing. If the workers had a
              dispute, we rough them up. If competitors tried to buy honey from
              Aringoth, we'd steal the shipments. In return, Maven allowed us
              to extort Aringoth and bring in a huge payout.

               So, how dangerous is it to cross her?
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                Let me put it to you this way: nothing happens in Riften
                without Maven's consent. One word from her and you could spend
                the rest of the fourth era in prison.

[The player prepares to leave.]

Brynjolf: You watch yourself on that island. Those mercenaries don't take
          prisoners.

[Optionally, one can ask Vex about her encounter.]

Dragonborn: I heard you ran into trouble at Goldenglow.

Vex: Hmph, yeah, I did. That wood elf s'wit...he's a lot smarter than I
     expected. Can you believe that fetcher had more than tripled the guard?
     There must have been eight of them in there. It was like he was daring us
     to come and get him.

Dragonborn: Any tips to get me in there?

Vex: Well, there's an old sewer tunnel that dumps into the lake on the
     northwest side of the island. That's how I slipped in there. Should still
     be unguarded.

[If the player finds Aringoth upstairs:]

Aringoth: Worthless mercenaries. I didn't think Maven or Mercer would allow
          me to get away with this, but I had little choice.

Dragonborn: I just want the key to your safe.

Aringoth: I can't. If I do, I may as well cut my own throat.

          What makes you think I won't? (Persuade)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I don't believe you. That's not your way.

          Then I'll take it off your corpse!
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Give it your best shot!

          Forget it. I'll just open it myself.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           No! I'm not about to let you ruin everything I've worked so hard
           for!

[If the player returns to Brynjolf after destroying too many hives:]

Brynjolf: You've made a mess and Maven is furious. I told you not to burn more
          than three of the hives! I've smoothed things over with her for now,
          but you can forget your cut.

Dragonborn: Sorry. Here's what was in the safe.

Brynjolf: At least you remembered one of the things I asked. Let me see that.

[If the player returns to Brynjolf after doing a satisfactory job:]

Brynjolf: Word on the street is Goldenglow's been hit. Good job.

Dragonborn: Yes, and here's what was in the safe.

Brynjolf: Let me take a look at what you found. Aringoth sold Goldenglow?
          What's that idiot thinking? He has no idea the extent of Maven's fury
          when she's been cut out of a deal, but I'm certain he'll find out. If
          only the parchment had the buyer's name instead of this odd symbol.
          Any idea what that may be?

Dragonborn: No idea.

Brynjolf: Blast. Well, I'll check my sources and ask Mercer. But for now,
          you're off to speak with Maven Black-Briar. She asked for you by
          name.

          Good, it's about time I met her.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Don't sound so eager, it's not a social visit. It's business.

          I thought I did the job like you asked...?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Oh, no. Nothing like that. You're calling on her for business.

          Sure, but will I come out of there alive?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Ha ha. If it was like that she wouldn't be asking for you, she'd
           be calling the Dark Brotherhood. It's just business.

Dragonborn: What does Maven want from me?

Brynjolf: That's between you and Maven and I prefer to keep it that way.

          • Just keep your ears open and your mouth shut and you'll do fine.
          • Don't worry about it. Maven's business dealings usually involve
            quite a bit of gold for her people.

Dragonborn: Speaking of which...

Brynjolf: Of course...your pay. Haha! You're smart as a whip, lad. Keep doing
          right by us and there'll be plenty more where that came from.

[Dragonborn tracks down Maven in Riften. If the player fouled things up:]

Maven Black-Briar: So you're the one who burned down Goldenglow Estate. Do you
                   have any idea what that little stunt you pulled is going to
                   cost me? I'm amazed you even bothered to show your face
                   here.

Dragonborn: My apologies, Lady Maven.

Maven: The only reason we're having this conversation is due to Brynjolf's
       assurance you won't botch another assignment. He claims you possess some
       sort of uncanny aptitude for your line of work. Quite frankly I find
       that hard to believe.

[If the player did the Goldenglow job right:]

Maven: So, you're the one. Hmm. You don't look so impressive.

       I'm the best at what I do.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Is that confidence I hear...or arrogance? Strange how often they're
        confused.

       Sorry you're disappointed.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        This is exactly what I'm talking about. Once again Brynjolf sends me
        someone with no backbone, no determination.

       How about we skip the conversation?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       You have to understand, it's been a long time since Brynjolf's sent me
       anyone I can rely on.

Dragonborn: You have no faith in the guild?

Maven: Faith? I don't have faith in anyone. All I care about is cause and
       effect. Did the job get done and was it done correctly. There's no gray
       area.

       You won't have that problem with me.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I hope not. This is an important job. I have a competitor called
        Honningbrew Meadery that I want to put out of business. I also want to
        know how they got the place up and running so quickly.

       Where do I begin?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Head to the Bannered Mare in Whiterun and ask for Mallus Maccius.
        He'll fill you in on all the details.

Dragonborn: Who runs the Honningbrew Meadery?

Maven: Some layabout named Sabjorn. Been a thorn in my side for the last few
       years now.

Dragonborn: Sabjorn seems like more than just friendly competition.

Maven: Not a day goes by that I don't regret letting Sabjorn get as far as he
       did. In only a few short years, he's taken that bile he calls mead to
       market and a chunk of my profits with it! I can't imagine where he
       found the gold to take it to market so quickly.

Dragonborn: So get rid of him and he's no longer a threat.

Maven: Exactly. With Sabjorn in prison, his meadery will be forced to close.
       Then I swoop in and take over the place. No more competition.

Dragonborn: Why strike now?

Maven: The Goldenglow Estate job has undoubtedly interrupted the supply of
       honey that I need to make my mead. Sabjorn could use this interruption
       to his advantage and take a larger share of the market. I can't have
       that.

Dragonborn: How did you become Allied with the Thieves Guild?

Maven: The Black-Briar family has always been allied with the Guild. Our
       connections with the Empire and within Skyrim make for a perfect fit. I
       dare say the Guild owes its survival as much to my family as it does
       to its own people.

Maven: One more time in case I wasn't clear. You butcher this job and you'll be
       sorry.

[The player travels to Whiterun's inn.]

Mallus Maccius: Can't a man drink in peace?

Dragonborn: Maven said you're expecting me.

Mallus: I'm going to keep this short 'cause we've got a lot to do.
        Honningbrew's owner, Sabjorn, is about to hold a tasting for Whiterun's
        Captain of the Guard, and we're going to poison the mead.

Dragonborn: You have the poison?

Mallus: No, no. That's the beauty of the whole plan. We're going to get Sabjorn
        to give it to us. The meadery has quite a pest problem and the whole
        city knows about it. Pest poison and mead don't mix well, you know what
        I mean?

Dragonborn: How do I fit in?

Mallus: You're going to happen by and lend poor old Sabjorn a helping hand.
        He's going to give you the poison to use on the pests, but you're also
        going to dum it into the brewing vat.

Dragonborn: Clever.

Mallus: Maven and I spent weeks planning this. All we need is someone like you
        to get in there and get it done. Now get going before Sabjorn grows a
        brain and hires someone else to do the dirty work.

        How do I get to the brewing vats?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Both of the buildings are connected by tunnels made by the pests
         infesting the meadery. There's an entrance to it in the basement
         storeroom of the warehouse that used to be boarded over. I've already
         removed the boards so the meadery would be infested. That's where you
         should start.

         What about just going in through the brewery?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Sabjorn keeps that locked up tight. If you can get through that way,
          go right ahead.

        Why are you doing all this?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I made the mistake of borrowing coin from Sabjorn. He's allowing me to
         pay it back, but he's working my fingers to the bone! He treats me
         like a slave...I have to do every nasty, dirty job in the meadery.

         There's more to this than a debt, isn't there?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          If this plan works, not only is my debt gone, but I'll be set up for
          life. Maven and I worked out a little deal. If Sabjorn ends up in
          jail, she's going to take over his meadery. And guess who gets to run
          the Black-Briar Meadery in Whiterun? You're looking at him.

        Why bother poisoning the nest for Sabjorn?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Once Sabjorn is out of the way, Maven has plans for this place. One
         way or another, we don't want the pests coming back. Consider it just
         more of the dirty work. I did my part getting them in there, now you
         need to clear them out.

        Remember, Sabjorn will be needing a helping hand. Make it look good.

[The Dragonborn goes to the meadery. Dead rats lie near the serving counter.]

Sabjorn: What are you gawking at? Can't you see I have problems here?

Dragonborn: Is something wrong?

Sabjorn: Are you kidding me? Look at this place. I'm supposed to be holding a
         tasting of the new Honningbrew Reserve for the Captain of the Guard.
         If he sees the meadery in this state, I'll be ruined.

Dragonborn: I might be able to help.

Sabjorn: Oh really? And I don't suppose you'd just do it out of the kindness
         of your heart, would you? I hope you're not expecting to be paid
         until the job's done.

         That's the only way I operate. (Persuade)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.

         You better, or I yell "skeever." (Intimidate)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions. Here's half. You get the
          rest when the job's done. My only demand is that these vermin are
          permanently eliminated before my reputation is completely destroyed.

         Just pay me when the job's done.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          My only demand is that these vermin are permanently eliminated before
          my reputation is completely destroyed.

Dragonborn: How do I "permanently" clear the vermin?

Sabjorn: I bought some poison. I was going to have my lazy, good-for-nothing
         assistant Mallus handle it, but he seems to have vanished. If you
         plant this in the vermin's nest, it should stop them from ever coming
         back.

Dragonborn: You've got a deal.

Sabjorn: Don't come back until every one of those things are dead.

         I haven't finished the job yet.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Why are you standing here then? I've told the Captain of the Guard
          we'll have the meadery cleared for the tasting and he could be here
          any minute.

         You mentioned someone named Mallus?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Mallus is the best deal I've ever made. Lent him a bit of gold some
          time ago I knew he'd never be able to pay back. Nothing like free
          labor to make operating costs cheaper.

         Now I've got to clean up this mess.

[After killing the rats and the human living with them, the mead is poisoned.
 The Dragonborn returns for his payment.]

Dragonborn: Job's finished.

Sabjorn: Well it's about time! I had to stall the captain until you were
         finished.

Dragonborn: What about my pay?

Sabjorn: You'll just have to wait until after the captain's finished. I
         suppose you can wait around if you must.

Commander Caius: Well, Sabjorn, now that you've taken care of your little
                 pest problem, how about I get a taste of some of your mead?

Sabjorn: Help yourself, milord. It's my finest brew yet...I call it Honningbrew
         Reserve. I think you'll find it quite pleasing to your palate.

Caius: Oh, come now. This is mead, not some wine meant to be sipped and
       savored. By the Eight?! What...what's in this?

Sabjorn: I...I don't know. What's wrong?

Caius: You assured me this place was clean! I'll see...see to it that you
       remain in irons for the rest of your days!

Sabjorn: No, please! I don't understand...

Caius: Silence, idiot! I should have known better...to trust this place after
       it's been riddled with filth.

Sabjorn: I beg you...please! This is not what it seems!

Caius: You...you're in charge until I can sort this all out.

Mallus: It will be my pleasure.

Caius: And you...you're coming with me to Dragonsreach. We'll see how quickly
       your memory cleans in the city's prisons. Now move.

Mallus: Look, I assure you, this is all just a huge misunderstanding!

Caius: I said move!

Mallus: Farewell, Sabjorn.

[Caius and his prisoner leave.]

Mallus: I don't think that could have gone any better. Anything else you need
        before you head back to Riften?

Dragonborn: I need to get a look at Sabjorn's books.

Mallus: So, Maven wants to hunt down Sabjorn's private partner, huh? You're
        welcome to take a look around Sabjorn's office. He keeps most of his
        papers stashed in his desk. Here, this should help.

        What are you going to do with this place?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Start changing it over to the Black-Briar Meadery as soon as possible.
         That was Maven's part of the deal. She's put me in charge of keeping
         the mead flowing, so that's exactly what I'm going to do. If you're
         in the area and you ever need anything fenced, you just let me know.

        You never mentioned that lunatic living in the tunnels.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I thought it would be better to leave some of the details out of our
         previous discussion. Didn't want to risk you walking away from the
         job. Besides, you've done Maven a favor getting rid of him and saved
         me from wasting coin hiring someone else to do it later.

        Remember to put in a good word with Maven for me.

[After finding a promissory note, it's time to report back to the Guild.]

Maven: I trust you have good news for me.

Dragonborn: Job's finished. Here's the information you requested.

Maven: This doesn't tell me much. The only thing that can identify Sabjorn's
       partner is this odd little symbol.

Dragonborn: Yes. I've seen that symbol before.

Maven: Well, whoever this mysterious marking represents, they'll regret
       starting a war with me. You should bring this information to the
       Thieves Guild immediately. There's also the matter of your payment. I
       believe you'll find this more than adequate for your services.

[Back at Brynjolf's...]

Brynjolf: Word on the street is that poor Sabjorn has found himself in
          Whiterun's prison. How unfortunate for him.

Dragonborn: Yet very fortunate for Maven.

Brynjolf: Exactly! Now you're beginning to see how our little system works.
          Maven sent word that you'd discovered something else while you were
          out there. Something important to the Guild?

Dragonborn: The same symbol from Goldenglow was involved.

Brynjolf: Then this is beyond coincidence. First Aringoth and now Sabjorn.
          Someone's trying to take us down by driving a wedge between Maven
          and the Guild.

Dragonborn: Is there anything we can do?

Brynjolf: Mercer thinks he knows a way to identify this new thorn in our side.
          He wants to meet with you right away. And if I were you, I'd hurry.
          I've never seen him this angry before.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[The player finds Mercer at his usual desk in the cistern.]

Mercer: Ah, there you are. I've consulted my contacts regarding the information
        you recovered from Goldenglow Estate, but no one can identify that
        symbol.

Dragonborn: I found the same marking at Honningbrew Meadery.

Mercer: It would see our adversary is attempting to take us apart indirectly by
        angering Maven Black-Briar. Very clever.

        You admire them?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         They're well-funded and they've been able to avoid identification for
         years. I'm surprised it reached this point. Just don't mistake my
         admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.

        Maybe we should recruit them.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        You just, but they've been able to avoid detection for years. They're
        obviously well-funded, driven and patient. Just don't mistake my
        admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay dearly.

        Clever or not, they need to die.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Don't dismiss our adversary so easily. They're well-funded, patient
         and have been able to avoid identification for years. However, don't
         mistake my admiration for complacency; our nemesis is going to pay
         dearly.

Dragonborn: How can we make them pay?

Mercer: Because, even after all their posturing and planning, they've made a
        mistake. The parchment you recovered mentions a "Gajul-Lei". According
        to my sources, that's an old alias used by one of our contacts. His
        real name is Gulum-Ei. Slimy bastard.

Dragonborn: Where do I begin?

Mercer: Gulum-Ei is our inside man at the East Empire Company in Solitude. I'm
        betting he acted as a go-between for the sale of Goldenglow Estate and
        that he can finger our buyer. Get out there, shake him down and see
        what you come up with. Talk to Brynjolf before you leave if you have
        any questions.

        Aringoth was a fool to think he could get away with this.

[If one goes to get extra info:]

Brynjolf: I can't believe Gulum-Ei's mixed up in all this; that Argonian
          couldn't find his tail with both hands. Don't get me wrong. He could
          scam a beggar out of his last septim...but he's no mastermind.

Dragonborn: Think he'll give me trouble?

Brynjolf: Trouble? He's one of the most stubborn lizards I've ever met! You
          have your work cut out for you.

Dragonborn: So how do I get him to talk?

Brynjolf: You're going to have to buy him off; it's the only way to get his
          attention. If that fails, follow him and see what he's up to. If I
          know Gulum-Ei, he's in way over his head and you'll be able to use
          it as leverage.

          Betrayal or not, I'll let him live.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I'm glad to see you're embracing our methods. It would be a waste to
           lose a contact at the East Empire Company before we had the entire
           story. Just keep on Gulum-Ei's tail and he's bound to step in
           something he can't scrape off his boot.

          He's going to owe us for this betrayal.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Aye, he does indeed...and with his fingers in the East Empire
           Company's pie, we'll make good use of that debt. If I'm not being
           clear enough, that means we don't want him killed. For now, just
           keep on his tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape
           off his boot.

          If he's betrayed us, I'll kill him.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           No, no, Mercer wants him alive. For now. Stubborn or not, he's the
           only contact we have at the East Empire Company. Just keep on his
           tail and he's bound to step in something he can't scrape off his
           boot.

          East Empire Company? Who are they?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           A mercantile group that has established ports all over Tamriel. They
           pretty much dominate the whole shipping industry. The Emperor
           himself supposedly backs them, which means they have fairly
           unlimited resources...so don't get their feathers in a ruffle.

          If I get information from Gulum-Ei, what then?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Just head right back to the Guild and get the information to Mercer.
           Nothing else is more important. If you discover Gulum-Ei's holding
           out on us and hs more loot stashed away than he claims, we'd find
           that information quite valuable as well.

          You think Gulum-Ei will give me trouble?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           There are thieves and there is Gulum-Ei. No honor, no code at all.
           He'd shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. The
           cut he's supposed to provide the Guild has dwindled as of late. He
           says pickings in the warehouse are slim, but I'm certain he's lying.
           Keep your eyes on him; he's quite crafty.

          How is Gulum-Ei an asset to the Guild?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Gulum-Ei works in the East Empire Company warehouse. He helps
           maintain all of the shipments of goods that goes in and out of
           Solitude. That means he has the pick of the litter from some of the
           finest goods to grace Skyrim's shores. He isn't exactly in the
           Guild, but he pays us a cut of all the stuff he lifts from the
           warehouse.

          Good luck in Solitude. Keep Gulum-Ei alive, but remind him who we
          are.

[The Argonian is found at Solitude's Winking Skeever tavern.]

Gulum-Ei: So, what do we have here? Hmm...let me guess. By your scent, I'd say
          you were from the Guild. But that can't be true, because I told
          Mercer I wouldn't deal with them anymore.

Dragonborn: I'm here about Goldenglow Estate.

Gulum-Ei: I don't deal in land or property. Now, if you're looking for goods,
          you've come to the right person.

Dragonborn: You can drop the act now...Gajul-Lei.

Gulum-Ei: Oh, wait...did you say Goldenglow Estate? My apologies. I'm sorry to
          say I know very little about that...bee farm, was it?

Dragonborn: You acted as a broker for its new owner.

Gulum-Ei: Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. I can't be expected to remember every
          deal I handle.

          Identify the buyer and we'll forget what we know. (Persuade)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I don't care what you promise. If I tell you the buyer's name and
           word gets around, it could ruin me!

          What would it take to identify the buyer? (Bribe)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Well, now that you mention it, there is something I've been trying
           to get my hands on. I have a buyer looking for a case of Firebrand
           Wine. There just so happens to be a single case in the Blue Palace.
           Bring it to me, and we'll talk about Goldenglow Estate.

          Give me the buyer's name or I'll kill you. (Intimidate)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Hasn't Mercer Frey taught you people anything? You kill me and your
           only contact with the East Empire Company vanishes. That's not smart
           for business.

[Dragonborn steals a case of wine from the jarl's palace, then returns.]

Dragonborn: I have the Firebrand Wine.

Gulum-Ei: Ah, I see you have the wine. Hand it over and we'll talk. Good. Can't
          have the buyer getting impatient and looking elsewhere for this, can
          we? Here, take this. I certainly can't use it, but I suppose I need
          to pay you something for the goods.

Dragonborn: You're trying to bribe me now?

Gulum-Ei: Not at all. I consider it an investment in prolonging my life. As far
          as Goldenglow Estate goes, I'll tell you what I know. I was
          approached by a woman who wanted me to act as the broker for
          something big. She flashed a bag of gold in my face and said all I
          had to do was pay Aringoth for the estate. I brought him the coin and
          walked away with her copy of the deed.

Dragonborn: Did she say why she was doing this?

Gulum-Ei: Not at all. I tend not to ask too many questions when I'm on the
          job. I'm sure you understand. However, I did notice she was quite
          angry and it was being directed at Mercer Frey.

Dragonborn: That's it? No name or anything?

Gulum-Ei: In this business we rarely deal in names; our identity comes from how
          much coin we carry.

Dragonborn: I think you're lying to me.

Gulum-Ei: Look, that's all I know. I never promised you I'd have all the
          answers. Now, since our transaction is done, I'll be on my way.

[The broker leaves and gets tailed into the East Empire Warehouse. Gulum-Ei
 uses a sheltered route behind some crates to reach a loot-filled cavern, a
 fact he's soon confronts him over.]

Gulum-Ei: Now, there's no need to do anything rash... This isn't as bad as it
          seems. I was going to tell Mercer about everything, honestly!
          Please...he'll have me killed!

          Mercer doesn't have to know.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I see you wish to be reasonable. Perhaps I misjudged you. The name
           of the person you want is Karliah.

          Tell me first, and then I'll decide.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Alright, alright... It's Karliah...her name is Karliah.

          Tell me now or I'll kill you where you stand!
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           No, please! There's no need for that! I'll tell you everything. It's
           Karliah...her name is Karliah.

Dragonborn: You say that name like I should know it.

Gulum-Ei: Mercer never told you about her? Karliah is the thief responsible for
          murdering the previous Guild Master, Gallus. Now she's after Mercer.

Dragonborn: And you're helping her?

Gulum-Ei: Help...? No, no! Look, I didn't even know it was her until after she
          contacted me. Please, you have to believe me!

Dragonborn: Where is Karliah now?

Gulum-Ei: I don't know. When I asked her where she was going, she just
          muttered "where the end began". Here, take the Goldenglow Estate
          deed as proof. And when you speak to Mercer, tell him I'm worth more
          to him alive.

          I'll keep quiet about your scam, but you owe me.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Now you're speaking my language. Tell you what, if you need any
           stolen goods fenced, you bring them to me and I'll pay you good
           money for them. Consider me your new friend in the north.

          I'm keeping the deed. Any objections?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Consider it a gift to ensure your silence. That thing seems to be
           bringing me nothing but trouble anyway. Karliah didn't even want it,
           she wanted to keep the sale a secret. I can see how well that went.

          Why did Karliah purchase Goldenglow Estate?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I asked her the same thing and she wouldn't come out and tell me.
           But now that I know who she is, I'd say she's trying to hit the
           Thieves Guild where it hurts.

           How would that hurt the guild?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Maven Black-Briar needs Goldenglow's honey for her mead. She's been
            using the Guild to keep the Estate under her thumb. If the owner
            cuts the Guild out of the picture, he's cutting Maven out of the
            picture...which she can't afford. If I was Maven, I'd blame the
            Guild for weakening and not being able to handle the place.

            Which makes Maven lose faith in us.
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Exactly. For the Guild to survive, they need Maven's support. This
             Karliah must have spent a lot of time and resources planning this.

          Now, you won't forget to tell Mercer I cooperated, will you?

[The player returns to the Guild.]

Mercer: Did Gulum-Ei give up any information on our buyer?

Dragonborn: He said Goldenglow was purchased by a "Karliah".

Mercer: No, it...it can't be. I haven't heard that name in decades. This is
        grave news indeed, she's someone I hoped to never cross paths with
        again.

Dragonborn: Gulum-Ei also told me she was a murderer.

Mercer: Karliah destroyed everything this guild stood for. She murdered my
        predecessor in cold blood and betrayed the Guild. After we discovered
        what she'd done, we spent months trying to track her down, but she just
        vanished.

Dragonborn: Why has she returned?

Mercer: Karliah and I were like partners. I went with her on every heist. We
        watched each other's backs. I know her techniques, her skills. If she
        kills me, there'll be no one left that could possibly catch her. If
        only we knew where she was...

Dragonborn: Gulum-Ei told me she said, "Where the end began."

Mercer: There's only one place that could be. The place where she murdered
        Gallus...a ruin called Snow Veil Sanctum. We have to go out there
        before she disappears again.

Dragonborn: We?

Mercer: Yes, I'm going with you and together we're going to kill her. Here's
        your payment for Solitude. Prepare yourself and meet me at the ruins
        as soon as you can. We can't let her slip through our fingers.

[TH06] SPEAKING WITH SILENCE |=================================================
_____________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player goes to Snow Veil Sanctum in Winterhold.]

Mercer: Good, you're finally here. I've scouted the ruins and I'm certain
        Karliah is still inside.

Dragonborn: You saw her?

Mercer: No, I found her horse. Don't worry, I've taken care of it...she won't
        be using it to escape. Let's get moving, I want to catch her inside
        while she's distracted. Take the lead.

        You want me to lead?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I'm sorry, I was under the impression I was in charge. You're leading
         and I'm following. Does that seem clear to you?

        Understood.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Just make certain you keep your eyes open. Karliah is as sharp as a
         blade. The last thing I need is you blundering into a trap and warning
         her that we're here.

        How did Gallus die?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Twenty-five years ago, I was standing outside these very same ruins.
         Gallus told me to meet here but he wouldn't say why. When I arrived,
         Gallus stepped from the shadows. Before he uttered a sound, an arrow
         pierced his throat. Before I could even draw my blade, her second
         arrow found its mark in my chest.

         So Karliah took on both of you alone?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Karliah was a master marksman and her greatest weapon was the element
          of surprise. I was lucky...she missed my heart by mere inches. I
          staggered away from the ruins and my vision began to blur. It's then
          that I realized the bitch had poisoned her arrows.

          And Gallus?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           The last thing I saw was Karliah dumping his body into an opening
           atop the ruins; an unceremonious end for a remarkable man. To this
           day, I've regretted letting her escape, even if it had meant I died
           trying. I owed Gallus that much.

           What happened after Gallus died?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            The Guild was thrown into disarray. Several stepped up and tried to
            claim Gallus' former position as Guild Master. Sides quickly formed
            behind these men and the Ratway became a bloodbath.

            And you were a part of this?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             I saw what they did to Gallus. I wanted to use the Guild's
             resources to hunt down Karliah. The others didn't even care he was
             gone. Fortunately, I perservered and the other groups were either
             killed or they left Skyrim.

             And what of Karliah?
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              The in-fighting had taken months to subside, which gave her time
              to go into hiding and carefully cover her tracks. I spent
              thousands of septims and used every contact at my disposal, but
              it was as if she had simply vanished...like I said before, she
              was the best.

        Tell me about Karliah.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         She was a stubborn Dunmer...always had to do everything her way. But
         she was also the best...bringing in more coin a month than some
         thieves heist in a year. Gallus trusted her too much and let her get
         too close.

          So, they had a relationship.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           If you want to call it that, yes. Me? I think she was softening him
           for the kill. Gallus would call her his "little nightingale". He was
           absolutely smitten by her.

           Why did she kill him?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Greed? Jealousy? Spite? Who can say what drove her to such an
            iniquitous act. One thing's certain: I intend to find out before
            she draws her last breath.

        Isn't murder Dark Brotherhood territory?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I have a long-standing arrangement with the Dark Brotherhood. If I
         need someone in the Guild taken care of, we do it ourselves. We both
         agree it's best to keep these matters in-house.

        Let's get going. I want her head on my mantle.

[They arrive at the ruins' locked entrance.]

Mercer: They say that these ancient Nordic burial mounds are sometimes
        impenetrable. This one doesn't look too difficult. Quite simple,
        really. I don't know what all the fuss is about these locks. All it
        takes is a bit of know-how and a lot of skill. That should do it.
        After you.

[The two head inside.]

Mercer: The stench in here...this place smells of death. Be on your guard.
        Pull the chain over there and watch out for the spikes. Looks like
        Karliah reset all the traps.

[They fight off boatloads of awakened draugr.]

Mercer: Karliah always was a nimble minx...slipping past these draugr must be
        child's play for her. We're on the right track. She's been through
        here as well.

[After more fighting, a long passage is revealed.]

Mercer: That door up ahead...looks perfect for hiding an ambush. Be ready.

[They come to a door requiring a specific claw object.]

Mercer: Ah, it's one of the infamous Nordic puzzle doors. How quaint. Without
        the matching claw, they're normally impossible to open. And since I'm
        sure Karliah already did away with it, we're on our own. Fortunately,
        these doors have a weakness if you know how to exploit it. Quite
        simple, really.

[He opens the door easily.]

Mercer: Karliah's close, I'm certain of it. Now let's get moving.

[As they enter the next room, the player is dropped to the floor by a hidden
 arrow containing paralytic portion. They can only watch the scene between
 Mercer and Karliah play out.]

Mercer: Do you honestly think your arrow will reach me before my blade finds
        your heart?

Karliah: Give me a reason to try.

Mercer: You're a clever girl, Karliah. Buying Goldenglow Estate and funding
        Honningbrew Meadery was inspired.

Karliah: "To ensure an enemy's defeat, you must first undermine his allies." It
         was the first lesson Gallus taught us.

Mercer: You always were a quick study.

Karliah: Not quick enough, otherwise Gallus would still be alive.

Mercer: Gallus had his wealth and he had you. All he had to do was look the
        other way.

Karliah: Did you forget the oath we took as Nightingales? Did you expect him
         to simply ignore your methods?

Mercer: Enough of this mindless banter! Come, Karliah! It's time for you and
        Gallus to become reunited!

[Instead, she drinks an invisibility potion.]

Karliah: I'm no fool, Mercer. Crossing blades with you would be a death
         sentence. But I can promise the next time we meet, it will be your
         undoing.

[She slips away. Mercer goes and stands over the player.]

Mercer: How interesting. It appears Gallus's history has repeated itself.
        Karliah has provided me the means to be rid of you, and this ancient
        tomb becomes your final resting place. But do you know what intrigues
        me the most? The fact that this was all possible because of you.
        Farewell. I'll be certain to give Brynjolf your regards.

[He stabs the player, walking away as they bleed out. Later, the player wakes
 up in front of the Sanctum. Karliah is there.]

Karliah: Easy, easy. Don't get up so quickly. How are you feeling?

Dragonborn: Hold on...you shot me!

Karliah: No, I saved your life. My arrow was tipped with a unique paralytic
         poison. It slowed your heart and kept you from bleeding out. Had I
         intended to kill you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Dragonborn: Why save me?

Karliah: My original intention was to use that arrow on Mercer, but I never had
         a clear shot. I made a split-second decision to get you out of the
         way and it prevented your death.

         Then I'm in your debt.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          More than you'll ever realize.

         Why should I believe you?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Without the antidote I administered, you'd be as still as a statue.
          I treated your wounds and didn't leave you defenseless.

         You should have shot Mercer instead.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I promise you, the thought crossed my mind.

         The poison on that arrow took me a year to perfect; I only had enough
         for a single shot. All I had hoped was to capture Mercer alive.

Dragonborn: Why capture Mercer alive?

Karliah: Mercer must be brought before the Guild to answer for what he's done.
         He needs to pay for Gallus' murder.

Dragonborn: How will you prove it now?

Karliah: My purpose in using Snow Veil Sanctum to ambush Mercer wasn't simply
         for irony's sake. Before both of you arrived, I recovered a journal
         from Gallus' remains. I suspect the information we need is written
         inside.

Dragonborn: Well, what's it say?

Karliah: I wish I knew. The journal is written in some sort of language I've
         never seen before.

Dragonborn: Perhaps it could be translated.

Karliah: Enthir...Gallus' friend at the College of Winterhold. Of course...
         It's the only outside Gallus trusted with the knowledge of his
         Nightingale identity.

Dragonborn: There's that word again, "Nightingale".

Karliah: There were three of us: Myself, Gallus and Mercer. We were an
         anonymous splinter of the Thieves Guild in Riften. Perhaps I'll tell
         you more about it later. Right now, you need to head for Winterhold
         with the journal and get the translation. Here, take these as well,
         they may prove useful for your journey.

         Can't you come with me to Winterhold?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I'm afraid not. There are preparations to make and Gallus' remains
          to lay to rest. I promise to join you there as soon as I can.

         Tell me about Gallus.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          He was a scholar, a master thief and a natural leader. Everyone
          respected him and followed him without question. It was Gallus who
          inducted me into the Nightingales and honed my skills to a
          razor-sharp point. I owe everything to him. We were...very close.

          You were lovers?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Gallus once said he felt comfortable around me; able to let his
           guard down. I can't help but think that I'm responsible for what
           happened to him.

         Why didn't you kill Mercer?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Mercer lied to the Guild, branded me a murderer and slandered my name
          across his network of contacts. For twenty-five years I ran, never
          sleeping in the same place twice and carefully covering my tracks.
          Mercer doesn't need to die...he needs to feel the cold sting of fate
          as his life crumbles in front of him and he's hunted by the Guild.

          Might not have a choice next time.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I can promise you if it comes to that, and my back's to the wall, I
           won't hesitate.

         Remember, speak only to Enthir. Trust no one else.

[TH07] HARD ANSWERS |==========================================================
____________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Enthir is found at Winterhold's inn.]

Enthir: Yes, yes, what is it?

Dragonborn: I've been sent by Karliah.

Enthir: Karliah? Then she's finally found it. Do you have Gallus' journal?

Dragonborn: Yes, but there's a problem.

Enthir: A problem? Let me see it. This is just like Gallus. A dear friend, but
        always too clever for his own good. He's written all of the text in
        the Falmer language.

Dragonborn: Can you translate it?

Enthir: No. However, I know someone who might. The court wizard of Markarth,
        Calcelmo, may have the materials you need to get this journal
        translated. A word of warning: Calcelmo is a fierce guardian of his
        research. Getting the information won't be easy.

        What exactly is a Falmer?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         In the time before man, they were known as the snow elves. They lived
         in the sunlight and had a very prosperous society.

         So they were like your kind?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Like the Altmer? Yes, I would say their culture quite possibly
          rivaled our own.

          What drove them underground?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           The Nords went to war with the Falmer in the First Era. Killed them
           by the thousands to drive them from their snowy homeland. The Falmer
           retreated underground and forged an uneasy alliance with the
           dwarves, who ended up betraying them. This betrayal made them what
           they are now...horrible, blind monstrosities with a burning hatred
           of any but their own kind.

           They sound more like victims to me.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Yes, I suppose you're right. Forgive me. I've lost several close
            friends to the Falmer and it tends to distort my view.

           You appear to despise them.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Why shouldn't I? The Falmer have killed more than a fair share of
            my acquaintances. They're animals...they show absolutely no pity
            or remorse.

           Then I'll make it a point to hunt them down.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Good. I lost more than a few acquaintances to the Falmer and I wish
            to see them avenged.

           If you wish to learn more about them, you're welcome to my tome on
           the subject. Should be on my table.

        What can you tell me about Gallus?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         He was a dear friend of mine and a surprisingly astute pupil of
         academia...I was devastated when he was killed. I suppose that risk
         always coexisted with his line of work; I just never thought his luck
         would run out.

         He was an academic yet he chose a different path. Why?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Well, for the thrill, of course. He was quite clear that he felt more
          in his element climbing through a window than hunched over a dusty
          tome.

          How did you meet him?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Ah, yes, quite an amusing anecdote actually. I caught him trying to
           break into my laboratory. I was about to show him the error of his
           ways when he made a curiously astute comment about my research
           notes. I was astounded and it in turn lead to a conversation. Who'd
           have imagined it would lead to such a strong friendship?

        Why did Gallus scribe his journal in Falmer?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Besides the fact that there are only a handful of people in Tamriel
         that even recognize the language? I'm fairly certain he was planning
         some sort of a heist that involved a deep understanding of the Falmer
         language. Sadly, we never had the opportunity to speak about the
         details.

         Where did he acquire the knowledge to use it?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Ironically, I pointed him in the same direction I pointed you, to
          Markarth and Calcelmo. I'm only hoping whatever means he used to
          learn the language will still be available to you.

        Calcelmo is stubborn as a mule. Be careful when you speak to him.

[The player finds Markath's court wizard.]

Calcelmo: Look, I'm very busy, so this better be important. What are you doing
          here? The excavation site is closed. I don't need any more workers or
          guards.

Dragonborn: I was looking for you, actually.

Calcelmo: I told you I'm not hiring any more guards. Why do you people always
          bother me when I'm trying to finish my research? You idiot. Do you
          even know who I am? The most recognized scholar on the Dwemer in all
          of Tamriel, and you people keep bothering me! I...I'm sorry, I...I
          got too excited. I'm in the middle of some very...stressful work,
          and I shouldn't have yelled. How can I help you?

Dragonborn: I hear you're the authority on ancient Falmer.

Calcelmo: Then you were well informed. I am at this very moment on the cusp of
          completing my magnum opus on the subject. I'm calling it "Calcelmo's
          Guide to the Falmer Tongue". It will revolutionize the way we
          understand those ancient beings.

Dragonborn: Perhaps I could view your work?

Calcelmo: Preposterous! That research represents years of personal toil in some
          of the most dangerous Dwemer ruins in Skyrim! You must be mad to
          think I'd allow anyone to see it before it's completed.

          Even after everything I did for you and Faleen?²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Well, I'm not blind to the fact that you've been instrumental in
           improving my affairs of the heart. If you wish, you may enter my
           tower to view the museum section, but I'm afraid the laboratories
           are still off-limits. That's the best I can offer.

          But I'm a great admirer of your work. (Persuade)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           While I appreciate the sentiment, I still have to decline. Being an
           admirer, I'm sure you can appreciate the need to keep my research
           a secret.

          What will it cost to change your mind? (Bribe)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I'm not certain how many scholars you're accustomed to dealing with,
           but I can assure you personal wealth is our lowest priority.

          Grant me access or you'll regret it. (Intimidate)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Do you realize that at the snap of my finger, I can bring the entire
           Markarth city guard to my defense? You best rethink this course of
           action or you may find yourself on the executioner's block.

          Forget it. Maybe I'll come back later.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Very well. Perhaps when my research is complete, I'll feel more
           comfortable discussing my findings with you.

[The Dragonborn enters the museum, then slips into the laboratories. He can
 overhear Aicantar, Calcelmo's nephew, in the distance.]

Aicantar: You heard me, captain -- our work must not be disturbed. Kill any
          intruders on sight. Call for backup if you need it. But let no one
          through.

Wizards' Guard: ...As you say, sir.

[After some slipping through the guard detail, the player sneaks into the
 research tower and finds a Falmer language "Rosetta Stone" for cracking the
 language. He takes a rubbing and prepares to leave, just as more guards are
 coming in.]

Aicantar: Yes, I'm positive I heard something!

Captain Aquilius: I...oh, alright. If there is a thief, he won't leave this
                  tower alive. But shouldn't we inform Master Calcelmo?

Aicantar: I'll deal with my uncle. Just...go! Scour this place from top to
          bottom!

[The Dragonborn escapes and returns to Enthir in Winterhold. Karliah's there.]

Enthir: Back, eh? And how was our friend Calcelmo?

Dragonborn: This should help translate Gallus' journal.

Enthir: I suppose it would be inappropriate of me to ask how you obtained this,
        so I simply won't. A rubbing, eh? Odd. I expected notes.

Dragonborn: It's quite the tale.

Enthir: I undertstand¹. Now, let me take a good look at this. Over here,
        please. Hmm... This is intriguing, but highly disturbing. It appears
        Gallus had suspicions about Mercer Frey's allegiance to the Guild for
        months. Gallus had begun to uncover what he calls an "...unduly lavish
        lifestyle replete with spending vast amounts of gold on personal
        pleasures."

Karliah: Does the journal say where this wealth came from?

Enthir: Yes. Gallus seems certain that Mercer had been removing funds from the
        Guild's treasury without anyone's knowledge.

Karliah: Anything else, Enthir? Anything about...the Nightingales?

Enthir: Hmm. Yes, here it is. The last few pages seem to describe "the failure
        of the Nightingales," although it doesn't go into great detail. Gallus
        also repeatedly mentions his strong belief that Mercer desecrated
        something known as the Twilight Sepulcher.

Karliah: Shadows preserve us. So it's true...

Enthir: I'm not familiar with the Twilight Sepulcher. What is it? What's Mercer
        Frey done?

Karliah: I'm sorry, Enthir. I can't say. All that matters is we deliver your
         translation to the Guild immediately. Farewell, Enthir...words can't
         express...

Enthir: It's alright, Karliah. You don't have to say a word. Listen, all I want
        is the truth to be revealed to the Guild. They respected Karliah, and
        she deserves better. Do whatever you can and I'll consider it a
        personal favor.

Dragonborn: Thank you, Enthir.

Enthir: If you ever manage to gain entry to the College, and you find trying to
        rid yourself of stolen goods becoming a burden, come visit me. I've
        been known to handle items of questionable interest from time to time
        and I'll see what I can do.

Karliah: You must hasten to Riften before Mercer can do any more damage to the
         Guild.

Dragonborn: Gallus' journal mentioned the "Twilight Sepulcher".

Karliah: You've come this far, so I see no harm in concealing it any longer.
         The Twilight Sepulcher is the temple to Nocturnal. It's what the
         Nightingales are sworn to protect at all costs.

Dragonborn: Why does it require that type of protection?

Karliah: Everything that represents Nocturnal's influence is contained within
         the walls of the Sepulcher. Now it seems Mercer's broken his oath
         with Nocturnal and defiled the very thing he swore to protect.

Dragonborn: Thieves and temples. It just doesn't add up.

Karliah: I felt the same way when Gallus first revealed these things to me. I
         think given time, you'll understand what I mean.

Dragonborn: I'd understand better if less mystery was involved.

Karliah: As a Nightingale, I've been sworn to secrecy regarding the Sepulcher.
         I know the Guild doesn't do much to foster faith, but I'm going to
         have to ask that you continue to trust me.

Dragonborn: Very well, we do it your way for now.

Karliah: I'll make for Riften and scout the situation; see if I can discover
         what Mercer's up to. When you're ready, meet me at the Ragged Flagon.
         In the meantime, I wanted you to have this. It belonged to Gallus, but
         given the circumstances I think he'd approve.

Dragonborn: I'll put it to good use.

Karliah: If the Guild isn't willing to listen to reason, you might have to.

[He takes Gallus' Nightingale Blade and makes for the Flagon.]

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[Karliah waits at the Flagon's entrance, far away from the sitting area.]

Karliah: I'm glad you're here. I think some of these people are beginning to
         suspect who I am. Are you ready to face the Guild?

         I'm ready. Let's go.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Keep your eyes open. I'm not sure what to expect when we enter the
          cistern.

         What if Mercer's there?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Then we'll show them Gallus' journal and hope for the best. Remember,
          we've got proof and all he's got is his word.

         No, I'm not.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Time is of the essence here, please hurry back.

[A thief is waiting behind the false cabinet.]

Garthar: They're waiting for you in the cistern. No tricks.

[The cistern is filled with the guildmembers, all readying their sword arms.]

Brynjolf: You better have a damn good reason to be here with that murderer.

Karliah: Please, lower your weapons so we can speak. I have proof that you've
         all bee misled!

Brynjolf: No tricks, Karliah, or I'll cut you down where you stand. Now what's
          this so-called proof you speak of?

Karliah: I have Gallus' journal. I think you'll find its contents disturbing.

Brynjolf: Let me see. No, it...it can't be. This can't be true. I've known
          Mercer too long...

Karliah: It's true, Brynjolf. Every word. Mercer's been stealing from the Guild
         for years, right under your noses.

Brynjolf: There's only one way to find out if what the lass says is true.
          Delvin, I'll need you to open the Vault.

Delvin: Wait just a blessed moment, Bryn. What's in that book? What did it say?

Brynjolf: It says Mercer's been stealing from our vault for years. Gallus was
          looking into it before he was murdered.

Delvin: How could Mercer open up a vault that needs two keys? It's impossible.
        Could he pick his way in?

Vex: That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can
     be picked open.

Karliah: He didn't need to pick the lock.

Delvin: What's she on about?

Brynjolf: Use your key on the vault, Delvin. We'll open it up and find out the
          truth.

[Delvin fulfills his role.]

Delvin: I've used my key, but the vault's still locked up tighter than a drum.
        Now use yours.

[Brynjolf uses his. The vault's contents are laid bare.]

Brynjolf: By the Eight! It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!

Delvin: The gold, the jewels...it's all gone.

Vex: That son of a bitch! I'll kill him!

Brynjolf: Vex! Put it away...right now. We can't afford to lose our heads...we
          need to calm down and focus.

Delvin: Do what he says, Vex. This ain't helpin' right now.

Vex: Fine. We do it your way. For now.

Brynjolf: Delvin, Vex...watch the Flagon. If you see Mercer, come tell me
          right away.

[Other guild members can comment on the recent heist or situation. This is
 optional, but still worth noting somewhere.]

Delvin: This is gettin' dangerous. Don't let anythin' get the jump on you.
Delvin: Stabbed in the back. It's like the Dark Brotherhood all over again.

Vex: If I see Frey, I'll pluck his eyes from his skull with my bare hands!
Vex: Need to stay focused in case Frey comes back, make it fast.

Rune: How can Karliah remain so calm when Mercer had her on the run for that
      long? Amazing.

Cynric: I never saw this coming. I thought we were just having a run of bad
        luck.

Ravyn Imyan: Vex is ready to tear you apart. I hope you have a good excuse for
             bringing Karliah here.

Niruin: Vex better leave a piece of Mercer for us. It's payback time.

Garthar: If I find Mercer first, I'm going to crush his skull with my bare
         hands!

Thrynn: I won't rest until Mercer's dead. How could he murder Gallus and betray
        all of us like that?

Sapphire: I dare Mercer to come back here! He takes one step in the cistern
          and I'll cut it off!

Vipir the Fleet: I can't believe he emptied the vault. Right from under our
                 noses.

Tonilia: There's no doubt Mercer will make for the borders of Skyrim. I hope
         you find him before he escapes our grasp. If you find Mercer, give no
         quarter...kill him and be done with it.

Vekel the Man: Word is Mercer Frey is a dead man. The Guild wants his blood. I
               can't say I blame them. Murder is not our way. Gallus was before
               my time, but I still can't believe it. You need to teach him a
               lesson...show him the penalty for betrayal around here.

[Back to the mandatory stuff...]

Brynjolf: Look, before I help you track Mercer down, I need to know what you
          learned from Karliah. I mean everything.

          Mercer killed Gallus, not Karliah.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Aye, I feared that was the case. From that last entry in Gallus's
           diary, it looks like he was getting close to exposing Mercer to the
           Guild. Anything else?

          Gallus, Karliah and Mercer were Nightingales.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           What? Nightingales? But, I always just assumed they were a tale...
           a way to keep the young footpads in line. Was there anything else
           she told you?

          Karliah was behind Goldenglow and Honningbrew.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Trying to make Mercer look bad in front of Maven, eh? Clever lass.
           Was there anything else?

          No, that's it.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Then, I have an important task for you. I need you to break into
           Mercer's home and search for anything that tells us where he could
           have gone.

Dragonborn: He has a house in Riften?

Brynjolf: Aye, a gift from the Black-Briars when the kicked the previous family
          out...place called Riftweald Manor. He never stays there, just pays
          for the upkeep on it. Hired some lout by the name of Vald to guard
          the place.

Dragonborn: I'll take care of it.

Brynjolf: Be careful, lad. This is the last place in Skyrim I'd ever want to
          send you. Just find a way in, get the information and leave. And you
          have permission to kill anyone who stands in your way.

          What's the best way to get into Riftweald Manor?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Good question. I've only set foot inside a few times myself and
           that was in Mercer's company. If you can get past his trained
           watchdog, I think your best bet might be the ramp to the second
           floor balcony in his backyard.

           I don't suppose the ramp is easy to access.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            No. It's some sort of crazy contraption commissioned for quick
            escapes. I'd wager a well-placed shot at the ramp's mechanism would
            lower it in a hurry.

          What's missing from the vault?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Better question would be "what did he leave." Mercer took
           everything. Even all of our plans are gone.

           Plans for what?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Before Mercer took over, Gallus started collecting every bit of
            material on locations the Guild could heist. Museums, keeps,
            estates...you name it. By the time Mercer took over the Guild we
            must have had a few dozen.

            How could he have opened the vault door alone?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             I don't have a clue. That door is impenetrable. Without two keys,
             it's impossible to open. I have a key, Delvin has a key, and
             Mercer has a key. That's it. There are no other copies.

          You mentioned a watchdog?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           That'd be Vald. A real piece of work, that one. Mercer's holding
           something over his head, keeping him loyal. Talk to Vex. She used
           to know him very well...if you catch my meaning.

          Careful at Mercer's place, I don't want to lose anyone else to that
          madman.

[If the player speaks to Vex on the matter...]

Dragonborn: Brynjolf said you have info on Vald.

Vex: That pig? Oh, I have info on him. More than you care to know.

Dragonborn: I want to get on his good side.

Vex: Vald? Good side? I think you have the wrong person. The only thing Vald
     understands is gold. A man after my own heart.

Dragonborn: So, buy him off?

Vex: Sure, but he'll ask for a whole lot. I mean, you are asking him to betray
     Mercer Frey. Your best bet would be to erase his debt with Maven
     Black-Briar. If you talk to her, she might be able to give you the
     details. Of course, you could just run him through and take what you need
     off his corpse...I could care less. While you're in there, help yourself
     to anything in Frey's manor. I would.

[If the player speaks to Vald:]

Vald: This is Mercer Frey's place and he don't like visitors. Now go away.

Dragonborn: I need to get inside Mercer's house.

Vald: No visitors. No way. Now piss off before ya make me mad.

      Mercer needs you in Markarth right away! (Persuade)
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Oh, come on, I ain't that dumb.

      I'll make it worth your while. (Bribe)
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       You ain't got enough coin to make my problems go away, unless ya can
       talk to Maven Black-Briar into lettin' me outta my debt. You try and
       set one foot in this yard and I'll cut it off.

      Let me in or I'll kill you. (Intimidate)
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Hahaha! That's funny. Ya think you can take me on? Try it anytime. I've
       been itching for a fight.

[If one then speaks to Maven:]

Dragonborn: I'd like to erase Vald's debt.

Maven: Vald? Why would you want to help that idiot? He owes me a steep debt.
       In fact, he's lucky all I did was force him to work for Mercer.

Dragonborn: What did he do?

Maven: A few years back, I commissioned a unique quill from a good friend of
       mine in Winterhold. Vald was tasked with getting it here safely and it
       ended up at the bottom of Lake Honrich.

Dragonborn: He's in debt because of a quill?

Maven: The wizards call it the Quill of Gemination and demanded a tremendous
       amount of gold to have it made. If you can locate the quill and return
       it to me, something Vald was too stupid to do himself, I'll consider
       the debt satisfied.

       What is the Quill of Gemination?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        The quill was supposed to allow me to duplicate any writing I'm viewing
        in exacting detail. I'm sure you understand how useful that would
        prove in a business situation, especially where signatures were
        involved.

        What if someone else got their hands on it?

         Fortunately, the quill required an ink with a unique formula known
         only to myself. So if you're getting any ideas abou selling it to
         someone else or keeping it, you'll find it would hold little value.

       How did it end up in Lake Honrich?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I had Vald meet the caravan from Winterhold on the western end of the
        lake so he could avoid the roads. The idiot got lost in the mist and
        ran his boat right over some rocks, sending it straight to the bottom.
        He's too stupid to remember where he was, and any attempt I've made to
        find it in the past has been unsuccessful.

        Any ideas where I can look?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Vald said his rowboat struck some rocks...I'd check under the water
         near one of the small islands in the lake. Perhaps you should start
         at the docks and work your way out towards Goldenglow Estate.

       I believe we're done.

[If the player recovers the Quill:]

Dragonborn: I found the Quill of Gemination.

Maven: Really? I wrote that off a long time ago. Well, I suppose I need to
       fulfill my end of the bargain. Give this document to Vald. It frees him
       from the debt, but I never want to see him in Riften again.

[If the player brings the note to Vald:]

Dragonborn: I have something of yours.

Vald: Of mine? What is it?

Dragonborn: Here, it's your debt with Maven. You're free.

Vald: I can't believe it! How'd ya talk her into this? Never mind, I don't
      care. I'm just glad I don't gotta work for Maven anymore. Here, ya did
      me a favor, I guess I owe you one.

[He gives over the key and walks off. Either way, the player will enter the
 house's hidden room and uncover Mercer's heist plans. Upon returning to
 Brynjolf...]

Brynjolf: I've scoured the town and I've spoken to every contact we have left.
          No sign of Mercer. Any luck on your end?

Dragonborn: He wasn't here, but I found these plans.

Brynjolf: Shor's beard! He's going after the Eyes of the Falmer? That was
          Gallus's pet project. If he gets his hands on them, you can be
          certain he'll be gone for good and set up for life.

Dragonborn: Then we have to stop him.

Brynjolf: Agreed. He's taken everything the Guild has left, and to go after
          one of the last greatest heists is just an insult. I've spoken to
          Karliah, and made amends for how the Guild's treated her. Now she
          wishes to speak with both of us. Quickly, we have no time to lose.

[Karliah walks over.]

Karliah: Brynjolf, the time has come to decide Mercer's fate. Until a new
         Guild Master is chosen, the decision falls to you.

Brynjolf: Aye, lass...and I've come to a decision. Mercer Frey tried to kill
          both of you, he betrayed the Guild, murdered Gallus and made us
          question our future. He needs to die.

Karliah: We have to be very careful, Brynjolf. Mercer is a Nightingale, an
         Agent of Nocturnal.

Brynjolf: Then it's all true...everything I heard in the stories. The
          Nightingales, their allegiance to Nocturnal and the Twilight
          Sepulcher.

Karliah: Yes. That is why we need to prepare ourselves and meet Mercer on
         equal footing. Just outside of Riften, beyond the Southeast Gate, is
         a small path cut up the mountainside. At the end of that path is a
         clearing and an old standing stone. I'd ask you both to meet me
         there.

[The player goes to the designated location, a dead end where the path has
 vanished. A gigantic stone is off to one side. The other two are waiting.]

Karliah: I'm glad you're here.

Dragonborn: What's the significance of this place?

Karliah: This is the headquarters of the Nightingales, cut into the
         mountainside by the first of our kind. We've come to seek the edge we
         need to defeat Mercer Frey.

Dragonborn: What kind of an edge?

Karliah: If you'll follow me, I'll try to explain on the way.

         Tell me about the Nightingales.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Gallus, Mercer Frey and I were once members of what is known as the
          Nightingale Trinity. The Trinity disbanded twenty-five years ago when
          Mercer Frey betrayed us by slaying Gallus and dumping his body in the
          ruins of Snow Veil Sanctum.

          Were they a part of the Thieves Guild?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Indirectly. The Trinity is usually selected from the ranks of the
           Guild, although its existence is a closely-guarded secret.

           What is their purpose?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            The Nightingales protect the Temple of Nocturnal, a place known as
            the Twilight Sepulcher.

         Who is Nocturnal?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          She's the mistress of night and darkness and the patron of every
          thief in Tamriel.

          I've never met a thief that worshipped anything.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Nocturnal isn't one for worship and reverence. There are no priests
           and no sermons, no services and no alms. She influences our luck and
           in return demands payment.

           Sounds like a Guild contract.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            You're closer to understanding than you realize. The only
            difference is she doesn't demand payment in the traditional sense,
            and sometimes the cost can be quite high. Whether you know it or
            not, Nocturnal dictates how well we perform as rogues.

            I have my skill, not powers or magic.
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Again, you have to think differently. Haven't you ever noticed how
             our luck behaves? Like a novice picking an impossible lock or a
             blind man suddenly turning to face you as you reach for his
             pocket? It's through these subtle means that Nocturnal influences
             us.

             Sounds like she just likes us to suffer.
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              Nocturnal's whim is the greatest mystery to everyone. There have
              been volumes written on the subject. Does she exact payment when
              we die? When we suffer does she revel in our misery? No one
              knows. The return certainly seems worth the risk though.

         Am I to become a Nightingale?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          It's my hope that you will, yes.

         What happened to capturing Mercer alive?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          From the moment you were struck with my poisoned arrow at Snow Veil
          Sanctum, my path changed its course. Perhaps I couldn't bring Mercer
          back alive, but together, we were able to clear my name and to put
          Gallus's remains to rest. I'd always intended Mercer's fate to
          ultimately be decided by the Guild, and it seems they've spoken.

         This way, please.

[A rock slides back in the cliffs, revealing the hidden Nightingale Hall.]

Brynjolf: So, this is Nightingale Hall. I heard about this place when I joined
          the Guild, but I never believed it existed.

Karliah: The assumption that the Nightingales were just a myth was seeded
         within the Guild on purpose. It helped avert attention from our true
         nature. What's wrong, Brynjolf? I can almost hear your brow furrowing.

Brynjolf: I'm trying to understand why I'm here, lass. I'm no priest, and I'm
          certainly not religious. Why pick me?

Karliah: This isn't about religion, Brynjolf...it's business. This is
         Nightingale Hall. You're the first of the uninitiated to set foot
         inside in over a century. Now, if you'll both proceed to the armory
         to don your Nightingale Armor, we can begin the Oath.

Brynjolf: I think we should trust the lass and take the deal.

[Each goes to one of the emblem-emblazoned stones and receives armor.]

Karliah: You appear ready for the Oath.

Brynjolf: Okay, lass. We've got these getups on...now what?

Karliah: Beyond this gate is the first step to becoming a Nightingale.

Brynjolf: Whoa there, lass. I appreciate the armor, but becoming a Nightingale?
          That was never discussed.

Karliah: To hold any hope of defeating Mercer, we must have Nocturnal at our
         backs. If she is to accept you as one of her own, an arrangement must
         be struck.

Brynjolf: What sort of arrangement? I need to know the terms.

Karliah: The terms are quite simple, Brynjolf. Nocturnal will allow you to
         become a Nightingale and use your abilities for whatever you wish.
         And in return, both in life and death, you must serve as a guardian
         of the Twilight Sepulcher.

Brynjolf: Aye, there's always a catch. But at this point, I suppose there isn't
          much to lose. If it means the end of Mercer Frey, you can count me
          in.

Karliah: What about you? Are you ready to transact the Oath with Nocturnal?

         Yes, I'm ready.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Good. After I open the gate, please stand on the western circle.

         I'm not sure I understand the terms.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          By transacting the Oath with Nocturnal, you're entering into a
          business deal. You'll be provided all the power and knowledge
          befitting a Nightingale. You're free to use those powers as you see
          fit, to further your own goals or the goals of the Thieves Guild.

          And in return?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           In return, you'll be required to defend the Twilight Sepulcher and
           everything within when the need arises. More importantly, upon your
           death, your spirit will be bound to the Twilight Sepulcher as one
           of its guardians.

           There's no going back?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Once the Oath has been struck, the terms are binding. Knowing this,
            are you ready to undergo the ceremony?

[In the deepest chamber, each person stands on a floor glyph.]

Karliah: I call upon you, Lady Nocturnal, Queen of Murk and Empress of Shadow.
         Hear my voice!

[Nocturnal manifests as a giant ball of energy.]

Nocturnal: Ah, Karliah. I was wondering when I'd hear from you again. Lose
           something, did we?

Karliah: My lady, I come before you to throw myself at your mercy and to accept
         responsibility for my failure.

Nocturnal: You're already mine, Karliah. Your terms were struck long ago. What
           could you possibly offer me now?

Karliah: I have two others that wish to transact the Oath; to serve you both in
         life and in death.

Nocturnal: You surprise me, Karliah. This offer is definitely weighted in my
           favor.

Karliah: My appetite for Mercer's demise exceeds my craving for wealth, Your
         Grace.

Nocturnal: Revenge? How interesting... Very well, your conditions are
           acceptable. You may proceed.

Karliah: Lady Nocturnal, we accept your terms. We dedicate ourselves to you as
         both your avengers and your sentinels. We will honor our agreement in
         this life and in the next until your conditions have been met.

Nocturnal: Very well. I name your initiates Nightingale and I restore your
           status to the same, Karliah. And in the future, I'd suggest you
           refrain from disappointing me again.

[All three people glow with blue energy, then Nocturnal disappears.]

Karliah: Now that you've transacted the Oath, it's time to reveal the final
         piece of the puzzle to you; Mercer's true crime.

Dragonborn: He's done more?

Karliah: Mercer was unable to unlock the Guild's vault without two keys because
         of what he stole from the Twilight Sepulcher...the Skeleton Key. By
         doing this, he's compromised our ties to Nocturnal, and in essence,
         caused our luck to run dry.

Dragonborn: So the key unlocks any door?

Karliah: Well, yes. But the key isn't only restricted to physical barriers. All
         of us possess untapped abilities; the potential to wield greater
         power, securely sealed within our minds. Once you realize the key can
         access these traits, the potential becomes limitless.

         The Guild should possess this item.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Although it would benefit the Guild more than you could imagine, in
          the end, it would do more harm than good.

         The three of us could keep it.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I'm afraid that's impossible.

         Sounds like no one should possess it.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Good, then you understand why this is about more than Mercer's lust
          for power.

         If the Key isn't returned to its lock in the Twilight Sepulcher,
         things will never be the same for the Guild. As time passed on, our
         luck would diminish to the point of non-existence. And whether you
         know it or not, our uncanny luck defines our trade.

Dragonborn: First time I ever set out to return something...

Karliah: Very true. In our line of work, it's quite rare we set out to return
         a stolen item to its rightful owner.

Dragonborn: Let's go.

Karliah: Before we depart, Brynjolf has some business to discuss. I suggest you
         listen to him.

Brynjolf: Listen, lad. There's one last piece of business we need to settle
          before we go after Mercer...the leadership of the Guild.

Dragonborn: Why tell this to me?

Brynjolf: Karliah and I had a long discussion before you arrived here. Thanks
          to your efforts, Mercer's treachery has been exposed. After we deal
          with him, all that remains is restoring the Guild to its full
          strength. As a result, we both feel that you have the potential of
          replacing Mercer as leader of the Thieves Guild.

Dragonborn: Me? What about you?

Brynjolf: I've been at this game a long time, my friend. A long time. I've
          stolen trinkets from nobles and framed priests for murder. I'm good
          at what I do, maybe even one of the best. But it's all I know. I've
          never been one to lead. Never desired it, never cared for it. Don't
          want it.

          I don't know what to say.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Well, we have a bit of an errand to run before your coronation, so
           don't get sentimental on me now.

          It's about time you asked.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Ha! Spoken like the leader of the Thieves Guild. Just don't lose
           yourself in the role. We have a bit of an errand to run before your
           coronation.

          No, it's not right.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Look. Everyone in the Guild admires what you've done. Maybe they
           won't come out and simply tell you, but I promise you it's true.
           And now they know Mercer never genuinely cared about the Guild. He
           lacked the loyalty you obviously possess. I can't think of anyone
           better.

Dragonborn: I accept.

Brynjolf: Then it's decided. When this is all over and Delvin's contacts assure
          me we've regained our footing in Skyrim, we'll handle the details.
          Until then, we have quite the task ahead.

Dragonborn: Then lets get to it.

Brynjolf: I've been pouring over the plans you brought us, and I'm convinced
          the Eyes of the Falmer are in the dwarven ruins at Irkngthand.
          Karliah and I will meet you there. Prepare yourself, lad. This will
          be a fight to remember!

          Do you think we stand a chance against Mercer?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           If you would have asked me that yesterday, I'd have said no. But now
           I think our chances have improved. Look, call me crazy if you like,
           but I trust Karliah. I don't think she'd lead us down a suicidal
           path. Besides, I'd rather die with some of Mercers blood on my
           blade than spend my life regretting that I ran the other way.

          I guess we're Nightingales now.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Aye, and some of what Karliah said is starting to make sense. Mercer
           may have damaged our reputation and raided our coffers, but this
           goes well beyond even his twisted form of larceny. Old Delvin kept
           calling it a curse and we all laughed at him. Looks like the joke's
           on us.

[If one talks to Karliah, 2 new options comes up.]

Dragonborn: I don't feel stronger.

Karliah: With the Skeleton Key missing from the Twilight Sepulcher, I'm afraid
         afraid Mercer's seen to it that none of us can benefit from
         Nocturnal's gifts.

Dragonborn: But she spoke to us.

Karliah: You merely transacted the Oath; signed the unwritten contract with
         Nocturnal. In order for us to receive our abilities...our end of the
         bargain, I'm afraid the Key must be returned.

Dragonborn: Then Nocturnal's angry at us?

Karliah: If Nocturnal was truly displeased with me...with any of us, she
         wouldn't have answered my call. I have no doubt that we still hold
         her favor and I believe it gives us enough of an edge to defeat
         Mercer Frey.

Dragonborn: May I ever return to Nightingale Hall?

Karliah: Yes. Now that you're a Nightingale, you may consider this your new
         home. You'll find that this place offers many things that will help
         you in your endeavors as well as a wealth of information for you to
         learn. Once the Skeleton Key has been restored to the Twilight
         Sepulcher, I'll make this place my home as well.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player reunites with the Nightingales in Irkngthand's Grand Cavern area.]

Karliah: Mercer's been here...I hope we're not too late.

Dragonborn: Those bandits back there...

Karliah: Brynjolf and I found them like that. Mercer's doing. We have to catch
         up to him before it's too late.

Dragonborn: I'm ready. Let's go.

Karliah: We should tread carefully. I wouldn't be surprised if he's left behind
         a few surprises for us.

[The player can have optional convos with the other 'Gales at this point.]

Brynjolf: Crime is one thing, murder is another. Mercer will answer for this.

          Do you think Mercer knows we're here?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           The lass seems to think old Mercer is pulling a fast one on us...
           leading us here and letting the dwarven constructs wear us down.
           I've learned to trust her lead at this point. After all, we
           Nightingales need to stick together, eh?

          What are the Eyes of the Falmer?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           A few years before Mercer murdered Gallus, the Guild took in a
           thief who specialized in dwarven antiquities. The thief had broken
           into a nobleman's home somewhere in Windhelm and made off with a
           small figurine of a snow elf with crystalline eyes.

           A snow elf?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Aye, that's what the Falmer were known as long ago...before they
            became the blind monstrositie they are today. When Gallus took one
            look at this statue, he knew it was something special. He took it
            right up to Enthir at the College of Winterhold. Didn't take long
            for Enthir to find a book in the college's library that told of
            Irkngthand and a great statue with gemmed eyes within.

            So the Eyes of the Falmer are gems?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Not just ordinary gems. They're said to be flawlessly cut and as
             big as a man's head. Can you imagine how much they're worth?
             Gallus and Mercer spent the better part of a month infiltrating
             Irkngthand, but the dwarves had protected the place far too well.
             There were just too many obstacles blocking the way. The plans
             were shelved and the rest is history.

Karliah: If Mercer leaves here with the Eyes, we'll never see him again.

         Do you think Mercer knows we're here?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Mercer's been careful so far. I don't think he'd just leave those
          plans behind unless he had his reasons. For someone in possession
          of the Skeleton Key, stealing the Eyes of the Falmer would be child's
          play. No, he means to ambush us down here, I'm almost certain of it.

         Both of you wait here a moment.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Alright, but don't wander ahead too far or else we'll be forced to
          come find you.

         Let's go.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Lead on, we're ready.

         Keep as quiet as you can. The Falmer are blind but they can still hear
         us.

[A ways ahead, through a massive barricade, they spy something creeping behind
 Falmer, killing them. It soon runs out of sight.]

Karliah: Wait a moment...what's that? It's Mercer! Look...down there!

Brynjolf: I'm on it, lass. Damn it! There's no way through.

Karliah: He's toying with us. He wants us to follow.

Brynjolf: Aye, lass...and we'll be ready for him. Let's keep moving.

[They continue a tour of the massive caverns.]

Brynjolf: Look at the size of this place. Have you ever seen anything like it
          in your life, lass?

Karliah: Can't say that I have. Imagine the riches hidden within these walls.

[The Nightingales find a debris-strewn room.]

Brynjolf: Looks like we can take the low road or the high road across this
          chamber. Your choice.

[They reach the other side after hearing a rumbling.]

Brynjolf: So this is what we heard. The entire tower collapsed.

Karliah: The only reason to do that would be to block pursuit. It must be
         Mercer. We'll have to find another way around.

[They find a chamber with Falmer and a large dwarven construct.]

Brynjolf: Shor' bones! Look at that monstrosity.

Karliah: It's a Dwarven Centurion. Very tough and very deadly.

Brynjolf: We can take the beast on or sneak around. It's your call, lad. We're
          right behind you.

[Further on...]

Karliah: This is where we saw Mercer. We must be getting close.

[Everyone heads into the next section, killing more Falmer by torture devices.]

Karliah: Even the Falmer don't deserve the pain these implements must have
         inflicted. The dwarves were a cruel race.

[In the next cavern:]

Karliah: There's a mass of the Falmer in this chamber. We can sneak through or
         take them down...I don't care. As long as we get to Mercer.

[In the shoddy tunnel beyond:]

Karliah: I can hear water rushing through these pipes. We must be beneath a
         lake.

[At the final door...]

Karliah: He's close. I'm certain of it. We must prepare ourselves.

Brynjolf: Then this is it. We do this for Gallus and for the Guild.

[They all enter the deepest chamber, where Mercer is trying to pry the gemmed
 eyes out of a massive Falmer statue.]

Karliah: He's here and he hasn't seen us yet. Brynjolf, watch the door.

Brynjolf: Aye, lass. Nothing's getting by me.

Karliah: Climb down that ledge and see if you can--

Mercer: Karliah, when will you learn you can't get the drop on me?

[He activates something, crumbling the ledge they're standing on.]

Mercer: When Brynjolf brought you before me, I could feel a sudden shift in
        the wind. And at that moment, I knew it would end with one of us at
        the end of a blade.

Dragonborn: Give me the Key, Mercer.

Mercer: What's Karliah been filling your head with? Tales of thieves with
        honor? Oaths rife with falsehoods and broken promises? Nocturnal
        doesn't care about you, the Key or anything having to do with the
        Guild.

        I don't believe you. Nocturnal guides me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Then it appears the shadows shroud more than your presence...they
         blind your wisdom as well. Our actions have always been one and the
         same; both of us lie, cheat and steal to further our own end.

        It's not about Nocturnal. This is personal.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Revenge is it? Have you learned nothing from your time with us? When
         will you open your eyes and realize how little my actions differ from
         yours? Both of us life, cheat and steal to further our own end.

        To blazes with Nocturnal. I'm here for the Eyes.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Wait a moment...do I detect a hint of genuine avarice from this noble
         thief? Perhaps Karliah and Brynjolf misjudged you and your true nature
         is no different than my own.

Dragonborn: The difference is I still have honor.

Mercer: It's clear you'll never see the Skeleton Key as I do...as an instrument
        of limitless wealth. Instead you've chosen to fall over your own
        foolish code.

Dragonborn: If anyone falls, it will be you.

Mercer: Then the die is cast, and once again my blade will taste Nightingale
        blood! Karliah, I'll deal with you after I deal with your irksome
        companions. In the meantime, perhaps you and Brynjolf should get better
        acquainted.

[Mercer uses his powers to control Brynjolf, making him fight Karliah. They
 both start parrying each others attacks.]

Brynjolf: What...what's happening... I can't stop myself.

Karliah: Fight it, Brynjolf...he's taken control of you!

Brynjolf: I'm sorry, lass, I...I can't...!

Karliah: Damn you, Mercer!

Brynjolf: Enough of this! Fight me!

[The player is left to fight Mercer alone, eventually dealing a coup de grace.]

Mercer: Shadows take me...

[With his spell over, the other Nightingales quit fighting and try the door.]

Karliah: Damn! This place is coming down! Quick, get the Skeleton Key and the
         Eye and lets¹ get out of here!

Brynjolf: No luck there, lass. Something must have fallen on the other side
          of the door because it isn't moving!

Karliah: We have to find another way out of here before the place fills with
         water!

[The water rapidly rises. At the last moment, part of the ceiling collapses,
 revealing an old, sealed tunnel hidden above the Falmer statue. They all
 take a breather in Bronze Water Cave]

Karliah: I can't believe it's over. After twenty-five years in exile and just
         like that, it's done. All that remains is to ensure the safe return
         of the Skeleton Key.

Dragonborn: Sounds like it will be a simple task.

Karliah: I'm afraid it's not that simple. When the Skeleton Key was stolen from
         the Twilight Sepulcher, our access to the inner sanctum was removed.
         The only way to bring it back will be through the Pilgrim's Path.

Dragonborn: I take it you never used the Pilgrim's Path.

Karliah: It wasn't created for the Nightingales. It was created to test those
         who wished to serve Nocturnal in other ways. As a consequence, I have
         no knowledge of what you'll be facing.

Dragonborn: Then we'd best get started.

Karliah: Brynjolf is needed back at the Thieves Guild to keep order while
         you're away. And I...I can't bear to face Nocturnal after my failure
         to protect the Key. I'm afraid you'll have to face the end of your
         journey alone.

Dragonborn: Don't worry. I'll return the Key.

Karliah: Take this with you. I'm not certain if it will help within the walls
         of the Sepulcher, but I certainly don't need it as much as you. I've
         had this bow almost my entire life, and it's never let me down. I
         hope it brings you the same luck.

         I don't understand why you won't come with me.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I've been a Nightingale for a very long time. I sold my allegiance to
          Nocturnal in exchange for many profitable years of thieving. Falling
          in love with Gallus was wrong. It was a distraction that allowed the
          Sepulcher to be desecrated and it likely cost him his life. Until
          the Key is returned, I will never set foot inside that place again.

         What's the story with the Pilgrim's Path?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional
          sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests.
          Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but
          they insisted they had her favor. As part of their "duties," the
          priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies, all on
          Nocturnal's behalf.

          This didn't interfere with the Nightingales?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           These priests weren't¹ threat to the Skeleton Key or the conduit to
           Nocturnal's realm, so they were tolerated. One of the ceremonies
           involved the Pilgrim's Path, a so-called "test of worthiness". If a
           pilgrim was able to complete the path, it was said they would live
           forever in twilight. What that means is anyone's guess.

         Tell me about the conduit inside the Sepulcher.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          The conduit to Nocturnal's realm, the realm of Evergloam, has been
          in Skyrim...well, longer than recorded history. The Twilight
          Sepulcher was constructed around it by man and mer in order to shield
          it from those who would exploit its power. It's through this conduit
          that we're given Nocturnal's greatest gift, our luck. What she gains
          in return is a complete mystery.

[TH11] DARKNESS RETURNS |======================================================
________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player journeys to the Sepulcher, tucked away in a corner of Falkreath. A
 single ghostly sentinel guards the temple steps.]

??????: I didn't recognize you, but I sense you are one of us. Who are you?

Dragonborn: I'd ask the same question of you.

??????: The last of the Nightingale Sentinels, I'm afraid. I've defended the
        Sepulcher alone for what seems like an eternity.

Dragonborn: The last? What happened to the rest?

??????: We were betrayed by one of our own kind. In fact, I'm to blame for
        what's happened here.

Dragonborn: How are you to blame?

??????: I was blinded. Blinded by dark treachery masquerading as friendship.
        Perhaps if I had been more vigilant, then Mercer Frey wouldn't have
        lured me to my fate and stolen the Skeleton Key.

Dragonborn: Wait a moment... You're Gallus!

Gallus: I haven't heard that name in a long time. How do you know of me?

Dragonborn: I have the Key.

Gallus: The Key! You have the Skeleton Key! I never thought I'd see it again.
        And Mercer Frey?

Dragonborn: Dead.

Gallus: Then...it's over and my death wasn't in vain. I owe you a great deal,
        Nightingale.

        I did this for Nocturnal.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's quite a noble sentiment for someone in our...well, in your line
         of work.

        I did this to honor the Guild.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You've done the Guild a great deed. And although they may not show it,
         I'm certain they appreciate your sacrifices.

        I did this to get rich.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Were I able to provide it, I'd shower you in wealth for what you've
         done.

        My only regret is that you had to undertake this task alone.

Dragonborn: Karliah helped me.

Gallus: Karliah...she's still alive? I feared she'd befallen the same fate,
        ending up a victim of Mercer's betrayal.

Dragonborn: Then take the Key and right all the wrongs.

Gallus: Nothing would bring me more pride than to return the Key, but I'm
        afraid it's impossible. From the moment I arrived here, I've felt
        myself...well...dying.

Dragonborn: How can a spirit die?

Gallus: The Sepulcher isn't merely a temple or a vault to house the Key. Within
        these walls is the Ebonmere...a conduit to Nocturnal's realm of
        Evergloam. When Mercer stole the key, that conduit closed, severely
        limiting our ties to her. 

Dragonborn: Then I'll have to proceed alone.

Gallus: I'm afraid so. I'm weakening, and I can feel myself slipping away. The
        years without restoration of my power have taken their toll. Whatever
        damage has been caused can only be corrected by following the Pilgrim's
        Path to the Ebonmere and replacing the Key.

        How does the Ebonmere affect all of us?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The Ebonmere is a conduit through which Nocturnal influences our
         world. Not through magic or blessings, but purely through luck.

         Luck is meaningless. What we do involves skill.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Yes, absolutely. Your skill is your own...don't let anyone ever tell
          you otherwise. But Nocturnal, she influences our luck; nearly
          imperceptible assistance we get when we ply our trade.

          How's that changing the way things are?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Think about the Guild...about the state it was in when you began.
           Think about all the little things you might have heard. A pick
           breaking when it shouldn't have, the clouds in the nighttime sky
           clearing at the wrong moment... Our access to those bits of luck
           are what separates us from common bandits.

           So with the Ebonmere closed, our luck's run dry?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Precisely. There are still a few who call Nocturnal "Lady Luck"
            and for good reason.

        What will I face in the Pilgrim's Path?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I wish I could help you, but I've been a prisoner in this very chamber
         for the last quarter century. The only possible help I've come across
         are the remains of some poor fellow who was trying to follow in your
         footsteps. Perhaps his journal can help?

        What's wrong with the other Nightingale Sentinels?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         With the Ebonmere closed, and the sudden severance from the realm of
         Evergloam, I fear they've undergone a drastic change. They're shadows
         of their former selves. They no longer remember their true purpose or
         their original identities.

         Why aren't you like them?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          My spirit didn't manifest itself in the Sepulcher immediately, so
          fortunately I wasn't present when the Ebonmere was sealed. However,
          ever since that day, I've felt my power waning...slowly draining
          away.

        Can't you just take the Key?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Whatever is affecting the Nightingale Sentinels is starting to affect
         me too. As I get closer to the Ebonmere I begin to feel myself
         slipping away. Even right this moment, I feel strange...when I don't
         think I should be feeling anything at all.

        Good luck, Nightingale.

[The player proceeds down the Pilgrim's Path, eventually ending up in a pit.
 With the Skeleton Key's potential-drawing skill, he opens a door through the
 floor, finding the locked Ebonmere portal. The Skeleton Key, when returned,
 opens it, summoning Nocturnal to the realm.]

Nocturnal: My, my. What do we have here? It's been a number of years since I've
           stepped foot on your world. Or perhaps it's been moments. One tends
           to lose track. So...once again the Key has been stolen and a
           "champion" returns it to the Sepulcher. Now that¹ Ebonmere has been
           restored, you stand before me awaiting your accolades; a pat on
           the head...a kiss on your cheek. What you fail to realize is your
           actions were expected and represent nothing more than the
           fulfillment of your agreement. Don't mistake my tone for
           displeasure, after all, you've obediently performed your duties to
           the letter. But we both know this has little to do with honor and
           oaths and loyalty. It's about the reward; the prize. Fear not.
           You'll have your trinkets, your desire for power, your hunger for
           wealth. I bid you to drink deeply from the Ebonmere, mortal. For
           this is where the Agent of Nocturnal is born. The Oath has been
           struck, the die has been cast and your fate awaits you in the
           Evergloam. Farewell, Nightingale. See to it the Key stays this time,
           won't you?

[Nocturnal disappears. The player goes over to Karliah.]

Karliah: I'm glad you were able to bring the Key back safely. Nocturnal seemed
         quite pleased with your efforts.

Dragonborn: Pleased? She sounded indifferent.

Karliah: I wouldn't take that to heart. It's her way. Think of her as a
         scolding mother continually pushing you harder to be successful;
         outwardly sounding angry but silently content. I assure you, had she
         been displeased with you, we wouldn't be having this conversation.

Dragonborn: What's thi about becoming an Agent of Nocturnal?

Karliah: The circles at the base of the Ebonmere imbue you with powers
         befitting a Nightingale Agent. The crescent moon represents the Agent
         of Shadow, the half moon for the Agent of Subterfuge and the full moon
         for the Agent of Strife.

Dragonborn: Why can't I be all three?

Karliah: This is Nocturnal's way of maintaining balance. If you ever feel the
         need to change your abilities, you can return to the Sepulcher and
         step onto a different circle. Be warned that once you've chosen, you
         can't reselect for at least a day.

Dragonborn: So what now?

Karliah: Now, your life as a Nightingale begins. Should the need arise, you'll
         be summoned to the Sepulcher in order to defend it.

Dragonborn: And you?

Karliah: The Guild has welcomed me back with open arms. I feel like a void in
         my life has finally been filled. I only hope this isn't an ending to
         things, but actually the beginning.

Dragonborn: The beginning of what?

Karliah: Why, perhaps the greatest crime spree Skyrim's ever known. There are
         pockets brimming with coin and coffers overflowing with riches ripe
         for the picking. We may be Nightingales, but in our hearts we're still
         thieves and we're damn good at what we do.

         Tell me about the Agent of Stealth.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          The Agent of Stealth is the master of remaining unseen. They are able
          to manipulate the darkness and use it to their advantage. On moonlit
          nights or in darkneed rooms, this agent literally becomes invisible.

         Tell me about the Agent of Strife.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          This Agent of Strife can send forth a tendril of pure darkness into
          the heart of another, causing great injury to them. At the same time,
          this tether will bolster the agent's own life force, making him
          stronger.

         Tell me about the Agent of Subterfuge.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          The Agent of Subterfuge utilizes shadow to cloud the judgment of
          those around him. By weaving the darkness to their will, this Agent
          can manipulate others into fighting for the Nightingale for a limited
          time.

         Choose your path and your journey will be complete.

[The player picks a power. At that moment, Gallus returns to the Ebonmere.]

Gallus: Karliah?

Karliah: Gallus! I feared I would never see you again. I was afraid you'd
         become like the others.

Gallus: If it were not for the actions of this Nightingale, your fears would
        have come true. He honors us all.

Karliah: What will you do now, my love?

Gallus: Nocturnal calls me to the Evergloam. My contract has been fulfilled.

Karliah: Will I ever see you again?

Gallus: When your debt to Nocturnal has been paid, we'll embrace once again.

Karliah: Farewell, Gallus. Eyes open...walk with the shadows.

Gallus: Goodbye, Karliah.

[Optionally, the player can ask more questions of Karliah now.]

Dragonborn: How will I know if I'm needed here?

Karliah: If this place is in danger ever again, the shadows will call. Should
         the need arise, a portal connects the Sepulcher and Nightingale Hall.
         Use it whenever you wish.

Dragonborn: Where will you be from now on?

Karliah: I've decided to make my home at Nightingale Hall. Since it's your home
         as well, I hope to see you and Brynjolf there. Of course, I may visit
         some of Skyrim's cities to "acquire" things from time to time. Can't
         afford to get rusty now, can we?

Dragonborn: Where did Gallus go?

Karliah: Gallus's oath has been paid. His actions have satisfied the terms. Now
         his spirit becomes one with the Evergloam...the realm of perpetual
         twilight and the cradle of shadow.

Dragonborn: So, he's gone?

Karliah: No, not gone...he's become one with the shadows. This is the greatest
         honor a Nightingale can hope to achieve. In death, he's become part
         of that which we use to live.

Dragonborn: They're a part of the darkness around us?

Karliah: Absolutely. When we say "walk with the shadows," we are asking those
         Nightingales who have passed on to protect us. It's believed that they
         are literally what guides our uncanny luck...by placing their hands in
         ours. That's why the Ebonmere needed to be reopened. Without it,
         there's no way Nocturnal was able to allow them through.

[TH12] UNDER NEW MANAGEMENT |==================================================
____________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

[The player returns to the Guild.]

Brynjolf: It's good to see you in one piece, lad! I just wanted to give you a
          proper thank you for everything you've done. The Guild is back on
          its feet again and on its way to a prosperous future. What's become
          of the Skeleton Key?

Dragonborn: It's been returned to the Sepulcher.

Brynjolf: That's it then. After all of those years helplessly watching the
          Guild decline. But enough of that...I'm confident that with you in
          charge, we'll soon have more gold than we could possibly spend.

Dragonborn: So, where will you be now?

Brynjolf: I'll be down here, trying to coordinate everything with Delvin and
          Vex; to make sure the coin keeps flowing...and no one skims! If you
          still feel like doing some jobs, I'm sure Delvin and Vex have more
          than their fair share to give out. Either way, it's been a pleasure,
          my friend. Here's to the future of the Guild. May it last another
          thousand years!

[After the speech, if the Guild is reestablished in all major cities, one is
 directed to talk to Bryn about becoming the outfit's new leader.]

Brynjolf: Well, my friend...the time's come to make it official. It's time to
          become our Guild Master. Don't worry, I promise this will be short
          and sweet. If you'll just meet us in the center of the cistern room,
          we can begin.

[Karliah, Delvin, Vex and the others gather round for the "coronation".]

Brynjolf: Look, I've never been good at these things, so I'm just going to keep
          it short. Being Guild Master means more than just getting a cut of
          all the loot, it's about being a leader and keeping this rabble in
          order. With that in mind, I propose that the position of Guild Master
          should be yours. Delvin?

Delvin: Agreed.

Brynjolf: Vex?

Vex: Sure, why not...

Brynjolf: Karliah?

Karliah: Absolutely.

Brynjolf: Everyone is in agreement, so all I can do now is name you Guild
          Master and wish you good fortune and long life. Now everyone, get
          back to work.

[This officially ends the questline. Most guildies will remark on the player's
 new appointment. Only Rune, Dirge and the special job merchants don't say
 anything new. Well, technically Rune talks about the ceremony, only he wasn't
 given a line relating to it afterwards.]

Brynjolf: You need anything, anything at all...don't hesitate to ask.

Delvin: So now the pupil is the master, eh? Good show!

Vex: I suppose you deserve it. Couldn't do any worse than Mercer anyway.

Karliah: I can't think of a better person for the job, Nightingale.

Maven: I suppose congratulations are in order. Now don't screw it up.

Tonilia: Here's to a long and prosperous future...may the Guild last another
         hundred years.

Vipir the Fleet: I am at your service.

Cynric Endell: As long as you continue to make us all rich, I'm behind you.

Thrynn: So, now that you're Guild Master, how about drinks for all of us!

Sapphire: Well, looks like you're running the show now. Good luck.

Niruin: We're all rich thanks to you. Cheers!

Garthar: Glad to see they picked the right person for the job.

Ravyn Imyan: I promise to live up to your expectations.

Vekel the Man: I haven't seen so much celebrating in years. Mercer's dead, we
               have a new Guild Master and things are finally looking up.
               Business is booming, coin is flowing and everyone seems content
               as things keep going our way. A new chapter in the Thieves Guild
               is being written this day and we all owe it to you. Many thanks.

[If the player asks Karliah about her new dialogue options...]

Dragonborn: About the secrecy of the Nightingales...

Karliah: I think by now, most within the Guild are well aware of what
         transpired between Mercer Frey and ourselves. The notion that the
         Nightingales are a fictive group has long since passed. If you wish
         to wear your Nightingale Armor within the Guild, I'm certain that no
         one would give it a second thought.

Dragonborn: How have things been now that Mercer's gone?

Karliah: I'm feeling a sense of inner peace...something I haven't felt in a
         very long time. Instead of being clouded with thoughts of revenge and
         retribution, I feel only serenity and fulfillment. Of course, I've
         been also dabbling in my old pastimes as well. Take a look around, and
         feel free to share the fruits of my labor.

[If the player asks Brynjolf about his new dialogue options...]

Dragonborn: So that's it? There's nothing else to it?

Brynjolf: Well, that's it. Sorry if it isn't the ceremony you were hoping for,
          but we're not exactly known for throwing our coin around. After we're
          done here, head over to Tonilia and she'll set you up with your Guild
          Master Armor. Oh, and one last thing. Here, I want you to take this.
          It's sort of a tradition around here.

Dragonborn: How's the Guild doing?

Brynjolf: Take a good look around you! Have you ever seen the Guild in such a
          prosperous state? With Mercer Frey gone and our influence spreading
          across Skyrim, the Guild's earned a new level of respect it hasn't
          seen in decades. I couldn't be more proud to be part of the Thieves
          Guild, or its new Guild Master.

[DW01] DAWNGUARD |=============================================================
_________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[On one's travels, the player finds an orc slaying a vampire.]

Durak: You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against
       the growing vampire menace. What do you say?

       What's the Dawnguard? 
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        We're vampire hunters. We search out and destroy those bloodsucking
        scum wherever we find them.

       I haven't noticed any vampire menace.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        You're not paying attention then. Like most everyone else around here.
        Haven't you heard that the Hall of the Vigilants was destroyed by
        vampires? They never took the threat seriously, and now they've paid
        the price.

        Vigilants? Dawnguard? What are you talking about?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The Vigilants mostly hunt down daedra worshippers, which is why they
         got torn to pieces when they went up against vampires. That's why our
         leader Isran is reestablishing the Dawnguard. Real, serious vampire
         hunters.

       Killing vampires? Where do I sign up?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Ha. Isran's going to like you. He's up the hill in the fort. He'll
        decide if you're Dawnguard material.

       Sorry, I'm not interested.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That's what everybody says, right up until they find their throat
        being ripped out by a pack of hungry vampires. If you change your mind
        and decide to join fight before it's too late, go talk to Isran up at
        the fort.

[The player seeks out Fort Dawnguard via a canyon passage east of Riften. A
 scrawny man is alongside the road nearby.]

Agmaer: Oh, hey there! You here to join the Dawnguard, too? Truth is, I'm a
        little nervous. I've never done anything like this before. I hope you
        don't mind if I walk up with you. Hey, uh, don't tell Isran I was
        afraid to meet him by himself. Not the best first impression for a new
        vampire hunter, I guess. You've probably killed lots of vampires, huh?
        I'm sure Isran will sign you right up. Not sure he'll take me. I hope
        so. That must be it. Fort Dawnguard... Wow. Bigger than I expected.

[They come upon a mammoth fortification, bigger than the Palace of the Kings
 or even Dragonsreach.]

Agmaer: Where is everybody? This place looks almost deserted.

[They come up to the main gate's steps.]

Agmaer: I guess this is it. Wish me luck.

Celann: New recruits? Hmm. Isran will decide if you've got what it takes. Go
        on, he's right inside.

[They enter the vestibule to find Isran arguing with Vigilant Tolan.]

Isran: Why are you here, Tolan? The Vigilants and I were finished with each
       other a long time ago.

Tolan: You know why I'm here. The Vigilants are under attack everywhere. The
       vampires are much more dangerous than we believed.

Isran: And now you want to come running to safety with the Dawnguard, is that
       it? I remember Keeper Carcette telling me repeatedly that Fort Dawnguard
       is a crumbling ruin, not worth the expense and manpower to repair. And
       now that you've stirred up the vampires against you, you come begging
       for my protection?

Tolan: Isran, Carcette is dead. The Hall of the Vigilants...everyone...they're
       all dead. You were right, we were wrong. Isn't that enough for you?

Isran: Yes, well...I never wanted any of this to happen. I tried to warn all
       of you... I am sorry, you know.

[He notices the player's presence.]

Isran: So who are you? What do you want?

       I'm here to join the Dawnguard.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Got a fire in your belly to kill vampires, eh? Good for you. But look
        around -- there's really not much to join yet. I've only just started
        rebuilding the order.

       I heard you were looking for vampire hunters.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        You heard right. I'm glad word's finally starting to get around. But
        that means it won't be long before the vampires start to take notice
        as well.

       I was just looking around. What is this place?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Why do I even post guards? This is the headquarters of the Dawnguard.
        Well, it used to be, a long time ago. As you can see, we have some work
        to do to restore it to its former glory. But maybe you want to help me
        with that?

       What can I do to help?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I need someone out in the field, taking the fight to the damn vampires,
        while we're getting the fort back in shape... Tolan was telling me
        about some cave that the Vigilants were poking around in. Seemed to
        think it was more related to these recent vampire attacks.

       What's the Dawnguard?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        We hunt down and kill vampires. Haven't you been paying attention? In
        the old days, the Dawnguard kept all of Skyrim safe from those
        bloodsucking scum. Then people stopped taking the threat seriously,
        the Dawnguard was disbanded, and the vampires came creeping back. Now
        I'm trying to reestablish the Dawnguard. Take the fight to the vampires
        for a change. I hope it isn't too late.

       I'll have to think about it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        While you're thinking about it, the vampires will be gathering strength
        in the shadows, waiting to strike.

[The player joins up.]

Isran: Tolan, tell him about, what was it, Dimhollow?

Tolan: Yes, that's it. Dimhollow Crypt. Brother Adalvald was sure it held some
       long-lost vampire artifact of some kind. We didn't listen to him any
       more than we did Isran. He was at the Hall when it was attacked...

Isran: That's good enough for me. Go see what the vampires were looking for in
       this Dimhollow Crypt. With any luck, they'll still be there. Here, you
       should take a crossbow. Good for taking out those fiends before they
       get close. Feel free to poke around the fort and take what you need.
       There isn't much yet, but you're welcome to anything you can use.

Tolan: I'll meet you at Dimhollow. It's the least I can do to avenge my fallen
       comrades.

Isran: Tolan, I don't think that's a good idea. You Vigilants were never
       trained for...

Tolan: I know what you think of us. You think we're soft, that we're cowards.
       You think our deaths proved our weakness. Stendarr grant that you do not
       have to face the same test and be found wanting. I'm going to Dimhollow
       Crypt. Perhaps I can be of some small assistance to you.

[He notices Agmaer nearby.]

Isran: You there, boy. Stop skulking in the shadows and step up here. What's
       your name?

Agmaer: I'm, uh...my name is Agmaer, sir.

Isran: Do I look like a "sir" to you, boy? I'm not a soldier, and you're not
       joining the army.

Agmaer: Yes, si...Isran.

Isran: Didn't I tell you to step forward? Hmm... Farm boy, eh? What's your
       weapon?

Agmaer: Uh, my weapon? I mostly just use my pa's axe, when wolves are attacking
        the goats or soemthing.

Isran: "My pa's axe," Stendarr preserve us. Don't worry, I think we can make a
       Dawnguard out of you. Here, take this crossbow and let's see how you
       shoot.

Agmaer: Uh, crossbow? I've never...

Isran: Yes, a crossbow. Best thing for killing vampires. Just take a few shots
       at those crates over there. Take a deep breath and let it out as you
       fire. You need to concentrate, boy. Try it again. You'll get the hang
       of it. That's it.

[They exit the castle.]

Celann: Isran found something for you to do, eh? I thought he'd like you. Good
        luck!

[DW02] AWAKENING |=============================================================
_________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player travels to the crypt, cut into the mountain slope near Dawnstar.
 Inside, one can hear vampires discussing something.]

Vampire: These Vigilants never know when to give up. I thought we'd taught
         them enough of a lesson at their hall.

Fledgling: To come in here alone...a fool like all the rest of them.

Vampire: He fought well enough though. Jeron and Bresoth were no match for him.

Fledgling: Ha. Those two deserved what they got. Their arrogance had become
           insufferable.

Vampire: All this talk is making me thirsty. Perhaps another Vigilant will
         wander in soon.

Fledgling: I wish Lokil would hurry it up. I have half a mind to return to the
           castle and tell Harkon what a fool he's entrusted this mission to.

Vampire: And I have half a mind to tell Lokil of your disloyalty.

Fledgling: You wouldn't dare. Now shut up and keep on watch.

[After slaying the fiends, one finds that Tolan, who had arrived first, was
 dead at their feet. The journey continues, eventually leading to a large,
 watery chamber where a kidnapped Vigilant is being interrogated by Lokil.]

Adalvald: I'll never tell you anything. My oath to Stendarr is stronger than
          any suffering you can inflict on me.

Lokil: I believe you, Vigilant. And I don't think you even know what you've
       found here. So go and meet your beloved Stendarr.

[He cuts down the hostage.]

Vampire: Are you sure that was wise, Lokil? He still might have told us
         something. We haven't gotten anywhere ourselves with...

Lokil: He knew nothing. He served his purpose by leading us to this place. Now
       it is up to us to bring Harkon the prize. And we will not return without
       it. Vingalmo and Orthjolf will make way for me after this.

Vampire: Yes, of course Lokil. Do not forget who brought you news of the
         Vigilants' discovery.

Lokil: I never forget who my friends are. Or my enemies.

[He soon forgets everything, as the player kills all the evil vampires. Using
 the central pedestal and the sliding braziers, the puzzle of the artifact is
 solved, revealing...a cute girl inside a coffin-like chamber?!]

Serana: Unh...where is...who sent you here?

        Who were you expecting?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • I was expecting someone...like me, at least.
         • I was expecting someone from my family. I don't recognize you. Are
           you one of my father's little acolytes?

           Who's your father?²
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            He's a very powerful man. Or he was at one point. I'm surprised
            another vampire hasn't heard of him.

        No, a group called the "Dawnguard" sent me here.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's not a name I know. And it doesn't sound like a name a group
         of vampires would choose.

        A man named Isran.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I...I don't know who that is. Is he...like me?

        That's not your concern.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I think it is, actually. Why would someone who isn't...like me...come
         all the way down here?

        What do you mean, "like you"?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         A...can't you tell just from looking at me? A vampire.

        Are you a...
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Vampire, yes.

        How did you know I was a vampire?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You think I can't tell my own kind? I smelled you almost before my
         eyes were open.

        You're a vampire?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Can't you tell your own kind? I smelled you almost before my eyes were
         open.

        The Dawnguard would want me to kill you.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Not fond of vampires, are they? Well look. Kill me, you've killed
           one vampire. But if people are after me, there's something bigger
           going on. I can help you find out what that is.

         • Don't think that'll keep them from turning on you eventually.
           They'll figure out what you are.

        Why were you locked away like this?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's...complicated. And I'm not totally sure if I can trust you.
         But if you want to know the whole story, help me get back to my
         family's home.

        Where do you need to go?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         ---

        As long as you don't get in my way.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I was going to say the same thing to you.

        My family used to live on an island to the west of Solitude. I would
        guess they still do. By the way...my name is Serana. Good to meet you.

[One can inquire further about her circumstances.]

Dragonborn: Any idea how to get out of here?

Serana: Your guess is as good as mine. This place looks pretty different from
        when I was locked away.

Dragonborn: Is that an Elder Scroll?

Serana: Yes, it is, and it's mine.

        Why do you have an Elder Scroll?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         It's...complicated. I can't really talk about it. I'm sorry.

        Is it fragile? Do we need to be careful with it?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ha. Nothing can destroy an Elder Scroll. Worry more about protecting
         your hide, and let me worry about my things.

Dragonborn: How long were you in there?

Serana: Good question. Hard to say. I...I can't really tell. I feel like it
        was a long time. Who is Skyrim's High King?

        That's actually a matter for debate.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, wonderful. A war of succession. Good to know the world didn't get
         boring while I was gone. Who are the contenders?

        Ulfric Stormcloak is the true High King.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I've...never heard of him. Is he well supported?

        Elisif of Solitude will be High Queen.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I don't know that name. You say she's Jarl of Solitude? Who supports
         her?

Dragonborn: The Empire supports Elisif, but there are many in Skyrim loyal to
            Ulfric.

Serana: Empire? What...what empire?

Dragonborn: The...Empire. From Cyrodiil.

Serana: Cyrodiil is the seat of an empire? I must have been gone longer than I
        thought. Definitely longer than we planned. Please, let's hurry. I need
        to get home so I can figure out what's happened.

Dragonborn: Why were you locked away?

Serana: I'd...rather not get into that with you. If that's all right. I'm
        sorry, it's not that...it's just that I don't know who I can trust
        just yet. Let's get to my home, and I'll have a better sense of where
        we all stand.

Dragonborn: Tell me about your home.

Serana: It's on an island near Solitude. Hopefully we can find a boat to take
        us there. It's my family home. Not the most welcoming place, but
        depending on who's around, I'll be safe there.

        Why wouldn't you be safe there?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Let's just say that my mother and father had a bit of a falling out.
         Don't worry, I'm not in any danger or anything like that. It'll just
         be more unpleasant to run into my father.

        Someone you don't want to see?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         My father and I don't really get along. Ugh, saying it out loud makes
         it sound so...common. "Little girl who doesn't get along with her
         father." Read that story a hundred times.

Dragonborn: Wait here.

Serana: I'll hang back a bit, but you're not leaving me behind. This is too
        important.
Serana: Sorry, I'm not that easy to get rid of. If you want to run ahead, I
        won't stop you, but I'll be following.
Serana: If you think I'm going to let you have all the fun, you're crazy. I'll
        let you lead ahead, but I'll be keeping an eye on you.

Dragonborn: Come with me.

Serana: Let's go.
Serana: Thought you'd never ask.
Serana: Whenever you're ready.

Dragonborn: I need to trade some things with you.

Serana: Hands to yourself.
Serana: Not going to happen.
Serana: Why don't you keep your things, and I'll keep mine.

Dragonborn: I think we should part ways.

Serana: I disagree.
Serana: You can't get rid of me that easily.
Serana: And go where? You can't just leave me alone whenever you feel like it.
        I'm coming with you, like it or not.

[Discussion over, it's time to find the exit.]

Serana: This feels like the right way. I was starting to worry. Does the air
        feel...heavy down here? I'm a little woozy, but it might just be from
        waking up.

[They finally escape the musty cavern.]

Serana: Ah, it's so good to breathe again! Even in this weather, it's better
        than the cave.

[If one travels to Fort Dawnguard before doing anything else...]

Serana: I don't like the feel of this place. I'll wait for you back by the
        entrance.

[If one talk with Isran before continuing on with Serana...]

Isran: So, any luck? Was Tolan right about the vampires being interested in
       Dimhollow Crypt?

       Yes, the place was crawling with vampires.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Good. I assume you took care of that little infestation. Did you figure
        out what they were looking for in there?

       Tolan was right. And he's dead. The vampires killed him.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Damn fool. I told him not to go. The Vigilants always had more bravery
        than sense. Did you at least find out what the vampires were looking
        for in there?

Dragonborn: It seems they were looking for a woman who was sealed in the crypt.

Isran: That doesn't make much sense. Where is this woman? Who is she?

       I don't know who she is. She says she lives in a castle near Solitude.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        (skip to "Well I don't know...")

       She didn't want to follow me here. But she wants me to take her home.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Home? Where's that?

        She says she lives in a castle near Solitude.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well I don't know what that means. But we need to find out. She must
         either have something the vampires want, or be someone important to
         them.

       I'm pretty sure she's a vampire, actually.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That would fit with the rest of it... I don't like it, but you did
        right to play along. We need to find out what this is all about.

       I won't lie -- if this were any other situation, I'd put her down just
       on the chance she might be a vampire. But this is something different.
       I'd say do what she wants. Take her home, and see who else is in this
       castle.

[On the NW coast of Skyrim, they find a small dock. An island castle looms on
 the northern horizon.]

Serana: That's it, out there to the north. We used to keep a boat around here
        to get there and back.

[With the boat in working order, they row to Castle Volkihar.]

Dragonborn: So this is your home?

Serana: This is it. Home sweet...castle.

        Why didn't you tell me it was so huge?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I didn't want you to think I was one of those...you know, the women
         who just sit in their castle all day? I don't know. Coming from a
         place like this, well...it's not really me. I hope you can believe
         that.

        It's impressive.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         It's something all right.

[They approach the locked front gate.]

Serana: Hey, so...before we go in there...

        What is it?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I wanted to thank you for getting me this far. But after we get in
         there, I'm going to go my own way for a while. I think... I know your
         friends would probably want to kill everything in there. I'm hoping
         you can show some more control than that. Once we're inside, just
         keep quiet for a bit. Let me take the lead.

        Are you all right?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I think so. And thanks for asking. (repeats "I wanted to thank...")

        What is it now?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Fine, don't worry about it. When we get in, you won't have to babysit
         about¹ me any more.

Watchman: Lady Serana's back! Open the gate!

[They enter the vampire clan's keep. A gruesome feast is going on.]

Vingalmo: How dare you trespass here! Wait...Serana? Is that truly you? I
          cannot believe my eyes! My lord! Everyone! Serana has returned!

Serana: I guess I'm expected

Lord Harkon: I can't believe it.

[They go down to the dining room.]

Harkon: My long-lost daughter returns at last. I trust you have my Elder
        Scroll?

Serana: After all these years, that's the first thing you ask me? Yes, I have
        the scroll.

Harkon: Of course I'm delighted to see you, my daughter. Must I really say the
        words aloud? Ah, if only your traitor mother were here, I would let her
        watch this reunion before putting her head on a spike. Now tell me, who
        is this stranger you have brought into our hall?

Serana: This is my savior, the one who freed me.

Harkon: For my daughter's safe return, you have my gratitude. Tell me, what is
        your name?

        I'm (name). Who are you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         ---

        You first.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Very well.

        I am Harkon, lord of this court. By now, my daughter will have told you
        what we are.

        You're vampires.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Not just vampires. We are among the oldest and most powerful vampires
         in Skyrim.

        You're a reclusive cannibal cult.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Not quite, though I can see how an outsider might arrive at that
         conclusion. No, we are vampires, among the oldest and most powerful
         in Skyrim.

        I don't really care what you are.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Perhaps you should. I count some of the oldest and most powerful
         vampires in Skyrim among the members of my court.

        For centuries we lived here, far from the cares of the world. All that
        ended when my wife betrayed me and stole away that which I valued most.

        Do I get a reward for finding your daughter?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I was about to suggest that very thing. Yes, you most certainly
         deserve a reward.

        What happens now?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You have done me a great service, and now you must be rewarded.

        There is but one gift I can give that is equal in value to the Elder
        Scroll and my daughter. I offer you my blood. Take it, and you will
        walk as a lion among sheep. Men will tremble at your approach, and you
        will never fear death again.

        And if I refuse your gift?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Then you will be prey, like all mortals. I will spare your life this
         once, but you will be banished from this hall.

        I'm already a vampire. What more can you offer me?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You contracted a disease, perhaps, but you are no true vampire.
         Accept my gift and I promise that you will learn the difference.
         Refuse me, and I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your
         life this once, but after that, you are prey.

        I'm a werewolf. What will happen if I accept your gift?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes, I can smell it on you. The power of my blood will purge that
         filth and make you whole again.

        And if I want to remain a werewolf?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I will banish you from this castle. I will spare your life this once,
         but after that, you are prey.

        Perhaps you still need convincing? Behold the power!

[He morphs into a demonic-looking vampire.]

Harkon: This is the power that I offer! Now, make your choice!

        I will accept your gift and become a vampire.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Be still!

        I don't want to become a vampire. I refuse your gift.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         So be it! You are prey, like all mortals. I banish you!

[If the player accepts, Harkon bites the player's neck and is lead to a back
 room with a blood fountain in it.]

Harkon: Awake at last, good. The power is growing within you, and now you must
        learn to wield it.

        I'm ready to learn about my new powers.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         With my guidance you will become a deadly instrument, striking terror
         into the hearts of mortals wherever you tread. Now, listen to my words
         and do as I instruct. The true power of the ancient blood is found in
         the form of the Vampire Lord. Assume the mantle of the Vampire Lord,
         and we will continue.

        What happened? How did I get here?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         My blood is potent. At first, the body is overwhelmed by it. After my
         bite, you collapsed and felt into a slumber. Now your flesh has
         acclimated to the new blood that courses through your veins. I assure
         you, no harm was done. In truth, your strength surprises me. Not all
         mortals can withstand my embrace.

        What is this place?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         A shrine to Molag Bal, the mighty Daedra Prince who is father to all
         our kind. Our power is a blessing from him. It is he who first
         bestowed the power of the ancient blood upon me.

         You made a pact with Molag Bal?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          In an age long forgotten to history, I ruled as a mighty king. My
          domain was vast, my riches endless and my power infinite. And yet,
          as my mortal life neared an end, I faced a seemingly invincible
          enemy -- my own mortality. I pledged myself to Molag Bal, and in his
          name I sacrificed a thousand innocents. In reward, he gave
          everlasting life to myself, my wife and my daughter. And so I have
          defeated mortality itself.

[The player shapeshifts into the Vamp Lord.]

Harkon: In this form, you can drain the life from your foes with your right
        hand. With your left hand, you can wield the power of blood magic to
        raise the dead. You can also call upon the powers of night to turn into
        a swarm of bats and reappear some distance away. Should you run out of
        magicka, you can descend to the ground and fight as the beasts do. Do
        so now and we will continue.

[The player stops floating.]

Harkon: Good. You are weaker while on the ground, because you cannot access the
        blood magic. However, the night powers are still yours to command, and
        your claws are still formidable weapons. Over time, your powers will
        grow in strength and you will find new ways to use your gifts. There
        is much to learn, but if you master the powers of the Vampire Lord,
        few enemies will be able to stand against you. There is one last thing
        you must know. Slaying mortal men with your life drain grants you new
        night powers and blood magic. I keep a stable of thralls in the castle
        should you need to feed like the baser vampires to stave off the sun.
        That is all I have to teach you. If you wish to be reminded of these
        lessons, you need only ask. I have a task that will test your new
        powers, but first, do you have any questions?

        I'm ready to carry out this task.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good. Go and speak to Garan Marethi. Tell him it is time. He will
         understand.

        What must I know about being a vampire?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         As a vampire, you will gain new powers, but also a weakness to
         sunlight. With each passing day that you do not feed, that weakness
         will become more deadly, but your powers will also become stronger.
         Feed upon those who are sleeping, and your vulnerability to sunlight
         will diminish along with your powers.

        Tell me again about being a Vampire Lord.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         When you first transform into a Vampire Lord, you will hover in the
         air. While you do, you will command the powers of Blood and Night.
         Descend to the ground, and you can attack with your claws and feed
         upon your prey to regain your strength. With experience, your powers
         will grow and you will discover new ways to use them.

[DW4a] A NEW ORDER |===========================================================
___________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[If one refuses Harkon's gift, the come to outside. With nothing left to do,
 one must report to the Dawnguard. The vampire hunters are fighting prey on
 their doorstep.]

Isran: Look at this. I should have known it was only a matter of time before
       they found us. It's the price we pay for openly recruiting. We'll have
       to step up our defenses. I don't suppose you have some good news for me.

       Not exactly.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Damn. Well what do you know?

       I have news, but I wouldn't call it good.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Of course. Why did I suppose differently. Fine, tell me what you know.

       The woman was a vampire, and they wanted her back.²
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        And so we delivered her right to them. I should've kept her here until
        we were certain...

       The vampires were looking for a woman trapped in Dimhollow.²
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        A woman? Trapped in there? That doesn't make any sense. Who is she?
        More importantly, where is she?

        She wanted to go home, so I took her to her castle.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I'm waiting to hear what any of this means.

        She's the daughter of a powerful vampire lord.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         And so you delivered her to them.

Dragonborn: They also have an Elder Scroll.

Isran: They what? And you didn't stop them? You didn't secure the scroll?

       I'm lucky I made it out alive.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Right. So they have this woman, and an Elder Scroll.

       There were too many of them, and only one of me.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        So they have everything they wanted, and we're left with nothing.

       I never got the chance.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I suppose you're lucky you're not dead. Or worse, one of them.

       By the Divines, this couldn't get much worse. This is more than you and
       I can handle.

       So you're just going to give up?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        When did I say that? We just need...we need help.

       We have to do something.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Well of course we do. I'm old, not stupid. We're just going to need
        some help. 

       If they're bold enough to attack us here, then this may be bigger than I
       thought. I have good men here, but... There are people I've met and
       worked with over the years. We need their skill, their talents, if we're
       going to survive this. If you can find them, we might have a chance.

Dragonborn: Where can I find the people we need?

Isran: Right to the point, aren't you. I like that. Not like those fools in
       the order. We should keep it small. Too many people, and we'll draw
       unwanted attention to ourselves. I think we'll want Sorine Jurard.
       Breton girl, whip-smart and good with tinkering. Fascination with the
       Dwemer. Weapons in particular. Last I knew, she was out in the Reach,
       convinced she was about to find the biggest dwarven ruins yet.

Dragonborn: She'll help us?

Isran: Might need a little convincing first, but she should. You'll also want
       to find Gunmar. Big brute of a Nord, hates vampires almost as much as I
       do. Got into his head years back that his experience with animals would
       help. Trolls in particular, from what I hear. Last I knew he was out
       scouring Skyrim for more beasts to tame. Bring the two of them back
       here, and we can get started on coming up with a plan. Watch your back.

[Gunmar is located near Ivarstead, tracking his prey.]

Gunmar: • You there, hold fast! I've tracked this damned bear for two weeks;
          I'll not let it have any more victims.

        • For two weeks I've tracked that bear, and now find that you've killed
          it on your own. I'm not sure whether that makes you brave or foolish.
          What brings you here?

Dragonborn: Isran needs your help.

Gunmar: Isran? Needing someone else's help? Never thought I'd hear that. I'm
        afraid he's a few years too late. I've moved on. I have more important
        business to attend to. Besides, he can handle anything alone! He
        assured me so himself. What could he possibly need my help with?

Dragonborn: We're up against vampires.

Gunmar: Vampires? That...well, that might change things. Tell me more about
        what's going on.

Dragonborn: We're not sure, but they have an Elder Scroll.

Gunmar: By the Eight...

        • All right, look. I'll consider it, but I just can't leave this bear
          to prey on more innocent people. Once it's dealt with, then perhaps
          I'll see what Isran expects of me.

        • All right. I'll hear out Isran, see if there's anything I can do to
          help. Where do you expect me to go?

          Dragonborn: Isran's at Fort Dawnguard.

          He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in.
          His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been
          up to all this time. I'll meet you there.

[They slay the bear.]

Gunmar: Don't know how well I'd have managed by myself. You have my thanks.
        You've helped me, so I suppose the least I can do is find out what
        Isran wants. He's still at that fort near Stendarr's Beacon, I assume?

        Yes, he said to meet him at Fort Dawnguard.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Of course he did.

        How did you know?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         If Isran is anything, he's stubborn.

        He's been working on that place for years now. Never lets anyone in.
        His own little fortress. Well, I guess I'll get to see what he's been
        up to all this time. I'll meet you there.

[Sorine Jurard is found in the Reach's wilderness.]

Sorine: You haven't seen a sack of dwarven gyros lying around, have you? I'd
        swear I left it right here. Do you think mudcrabs might've taken it?
        I saw one the other day... Wouldn't be surprised if it followed me
        here. Just look around, will you?

Dragonborn: Isran asked me to find you.

Sorine: Isran? Wants me? No, you must be mistaken. He made it exceedingly clear
        the last time we spoke that he had no interest in my help. I find it
        hard to believe he changed his mind. He said some very hurtful things
        to me before I left. Anyway, I'm quite happy with my current pursuits.
        So if you'll excuse me...

        You had a falling out?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes, that was my point. I felt it was rather clear. Look, what is it
         you want from me?

        Vampires threaten all of Skyrim. We need your help.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Vampires? Really? Oh, and I suppose now he remembers that I proposed
         no less than three different scenarios that involved vampires
         overrunning the population. Well, what are they up to?

        They have an Elder Scroll.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I... Well, that's actually something I never would've anticipated.
         Interesting. I'm not sure what they would want with one, but in this
         case Isran is probably correct in thinking it isn't good.

        We're not sure, but Isran is concerned.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         In case you haven't noticed, Isran is always concerned about
         something. That's what got us working together in the first place.
         Still, if he sent you to find me, it may actually be pretty bad.

        All right. If nothing else, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to learn more
        about what's going on so I can better defend myself. But I'm not just
        going to abandon what I've been working on here. It's too useful. I
        need at least one intact dwarven gyro. So either I need to find the
        satchel those mudcrabs stole, or I need another gyro from someplace.
        You wouldn't happen to have one, would you?

        There's no time. You need to get moving now. (Persuade)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Fine, fine! I can't afford to forget about this work, though. Some
           very interesting applications. Now where is it I'm supposed to be
           going?

         • I'm sorry, but I'm not about to do that without at least a single
           gyro to show for my efforts.

        Here, I've got a dwarven gyro. Take it.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Thank you! It's not much, but this will help a great deal with some
         things I've been researching. Now where is it I'm supposed to be
         going?

        I don't have any gyros on me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well then I'm very sorry, but I just can't walk away from this project
         yet.

Dragonborn: We're meeting at Fort Dawnguard.

Sorine: Ah. Been working more on his secret hideout, has he? It'll be
        interesting to see how much progress he's made. I'll finish up here and
        head in that direction soon as I can. See you there.

[With the two helpers recruited, it's time to report to Isran. The player
 arrives just in time to see them arrive. Isran raises inner gates, forcing
 them to stand in the main entry.]

Gunmar: All right Isran, you've got us all here. Now what do you want?

Isran: Hold it right there.

[A bright light erupts from the center.]

Sorine: What are you doing?

Isran: Making sure you're not vampires. Can't be too careful.

[He shuts the magical light off.]

Isran: So, welcome to Fort Dawnguard. I'm sure you've heard a bit of what we're
       up against. Powerful vampires, unlike anything we've seen before. And
       they have an Elder Scroll. If anyone is going to stand in their way,
       it's going to be us.

Sorine: This is all well and good, but do we actually know anything about what
        they're doing? What do we do now?

Isran: We'll get to that. For now, get acquainted with the space. Sorine,
       you'll find room to start your tinkering on that crossbow design you've
       been working on. Gunmar, there's an area large enough for you to pen up
       some trolls, get them armored up and ready to use.

[He looks at the player.]

Isran: In the meantime, we're going to get to the bottom of why a vampire
       showed up here looking for you. Let's go have a little chat with it,
       shall we?

[DW4b] THE BLOODSTONE CHALICE |================================================
______________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[One visits Merethi as Harkon instructed.]

Dragonborn: I have a message from Harkon.

Garan: Lord Harkon. Remember your place. Now, what is our Lord's wish?

Dragonborn: He simply said "It is time."

Garan: Well, well. He wants the Chalice, then. You've heard of the Bloodstone
       Chalice?

       I've never heard of it.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        It is a rather well-kept secret.

       Of course. Hasn't everyone?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        No. Don't try and impress me. It only leaves you looking foolish.

       The Chalice has been in Lord Harkon's possession for quite some time
       now. It is, when used properly, able to increase the potency of our
       powers. He has neglected using it for ages. If he wants it filled now,
       then grander things are afoot. This is good. Follow me. I'll take you
       to it.

[They start walking to the dining room.]

Garan: Lord Harkon has never cared to use the Chalice, relying on his more than
       adequate powers until now. This is an intriguing change.

[They arrive.]

Garan: Excuse us. I need to fetch the Bloodstone Chalice.

Vingalmo: The Chalice? Why?

Orthjolf: What are you up to, Garan?

Garan: Lord Harkon's orders, Orthjolf. Calm yourself. Our friend here has been
       ordered to fill the Chalice.

Vingalmo: Really?

Garan: Indeed. He's off to Redwater Den.

Orthjolf: Well, then... Best of luck to you.

Garan: Vingalmo and Orthjolf are Harkon's primary advisors. I'm sure they're
       quite surprised to learn that you're taking the Chalice. And here we
       are.

[They find a large chalice on a small pedestal.]

Garan: Now, this Chalice needs to be filled directly from the bloodspring
       that is the source of Redwater Den. But that's not enough. Once that's
       done, the blood of a powerful vampire needs to be added to it. Keep in
       mind that Redwater Den has fallen into...well, let's just say less
       reputable members of society now dwell there. It's your choice whether
       to attempt to deal with them or force your way through. Hurry back. You
       don't want to keep Lord Harkon waiting.

[The player travels to Redwater Den, near Riften's Lake Honrich. The place is
 a vampire-run skooma distillery, apparently meant to create addicts that can
 be preyed upon.]

Doorman: Hold it. If you're going downstairs, you keep your weapons to yourself
         or we'll be getting better acquainted. Head on in and behave yourself.

[One way or another, one enters the back caverns and finds Redwater's spring.
 The overhear vampires talking nearby.]

Thrall: So why don't you just drink the blood from the spring? I mean, that
        seems easier than running a skooma den...

Vampire: The boss said it's some sort of profaned spring. It looks like blood,
         but it's not the real thing. Drinking it gives you strength, but it
         also gets you pretty messed up... That's why we thought of putting it
         in the skooma.

[After cutting through an entire den, the spring's source is uncovered. One
 fills the chalice. Two Volkihar vampires show themselves.]

Salonia Caelia: It's really too bad, you know. The little accident you had
                here, completely unexpected...

Stalf: Yeah, too bad. Lord Harkon's new favorite, dead so soon after joining
       the family.

Salonia: We're just lucky I was here to return the Chalice to Vingalmo, so he
         could make sure Harkon gets it back.

Stalf: Wait, what? That's not what we agreed. We take it back together.

Salonia: Idiot. You didn't really think I'd let you walk out of here either,
         did you? Vingalmo wants you both dead.

Stalf: Well, that's just fine. Orthjolf told me to finish off anyone who got
       in the way.

[The Dragonborn slays both traitorous vampires, then returns to Marethi.]

Garan: I see you have returned. Lord Harkon will be pleased. You met Stalf and
       Salonia, I assume? Lord Harkon and I suspected they might follow you
       there.

       They tried to kill me!
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Well of course they did.

       I killed them both.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        As well you should have.

       Welcome to the politics of Lord Harkon's court. Vingalmo and Orthjolf
       both long for our Lord's throne, but cannot make overt moves against
       him. Each sought to gain power by using his underling to kill you and
       keep the Chalice for himself. By ensuring the Chalice reaches our Lord,
       you have increased his power over them, and at the same time deprived
       them of their little pets. You've done Lord Harkon two great services.
       Take what you've learned to heart, and be careful who you trust. Now, I
       believe Lord Harkon wishes to speak with you.

[DW5a] PROPHET |===============================================================
_______________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player goes with Isran to the balcony rooms, finding Serana there.]

Isran: This vampire showed up while you were away. I'm guessing it's the one
       you found in Dimhollow Crypt. Says it's got something really important
       to say to you. So let's hear it.

Serana: You probably weren't expecting to see me again.

Dragonborn: What are you doing here?

Serana: I'd rather not be here either, but I needed to talk to you. It's
        important, so please just listen before your friend, here, loses his
        patience. It's...well, it's about me. And the Elder Scroll that was
        buried with me.

        What about the scroll?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The reason I had it...and why I was down there. It all comes back to
         my father.

        What about you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The reason I was down there...and why I had the Elder Scroll. It all
         comes back to my father.

        I'm guessing you figured this part out already, but my father's not
        exactly a good person. Even by vampire standards. He wasn't always like
        that, though. There was...a turn. He stumbled onto this obscure
        prophecy and just kind of lost himself in it.

        What sort of prophecy?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         It's pointless and vague, like all prophecies. The part he latched
         onto said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun. That's
         what he's after. He wants to control the sun, have vampires control
         the world.

        What do you mean..."lost himself"?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         He just became absorbed...obsessed. It was kind of sick, actually.
         The prophecy said that vampires would no longer need to fear the sun.
         For someone who fancied himself as vampire royalty, that's pretty
         seductive.

        Anyway, my mother and I didn't feel like inviting a war with all of
        Tamriel, so we tried to stop him. That's why I was sealed away with the
        Scroll.

        What's all this have to do with the Dawnguard?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I'm sorry, I had heard there were vampire hunters here. I thought
         they might want to know about a vampire plot to enslave the rest of
         the world. Was I wrong?

        You took a big risk coming here.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I did. But something about you makes me think I can trust you. I hope
         I'm not wrong.

        No, you're right. We just have to convince the others you're on our
        side. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well, let's move then. I'm nothing if not persuasive.

        You want us to help you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That was the plan, yes. Assuming the rest of them can trust a vampire.
         Come on, I'll need you to help convince them.

Isran: All right, you've heard what it has to say. Now tell me, is there any
       reason I shouldn't kill this bloodsucking fiend right now?

       Because we're going to need her help.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Why, because of that story about the prophecy? About some vampire
        trying to put the sun out? Do you actually believe any of that?

        Why else would she risk her life to come here?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Who knows, maybe it has a death wish. Maybe it's just insane. I don't
         really care.

       Set your hatred aside and try to see the larger picture, Isran.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Set my hatred aside? Not a chance. It's what keeps me strong.

        You don't trust her, fine. Trust me. I believe here.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You'd better know what you're doing.

       It can stay for now, but if it so much as lays a finger on anyone here,
       I'll hold you responsible. Got it?

[He turns to Serana.]

Isran: You hear me? Don't feel like a guest, because you're not. You're a
       resource. You're an asset. In the meantime, don't make me regret my
       sudden outburst of tolerance and generosity, because if you do, your
       friend here is going to pay for it.

Serana: Thank you for your kindness. I'll remember it the next time I'm feeling
        hungry. So, in case you didn't notice the giant thing I have on my
        back, I have the Elder Scroll with me. Whatever it says, it will have
        something that can help us. But of course, neither of us can read it.

Dragonborn: Who can?

Serana: Well, the Moth Priests are the only ones I've heard who can do it. They
        spend years preparing before they start reading, though. Not that it
        helps us, anyway, because they're half a continent away in Cyrodiil.

Isran: Some Imperial scholar arrived in Skyrim a few days ago. I was staking
       out the road when I saw him pass by. Maybe that's your Moth Priest.

Serana: Do you know where he's staying now?

Isran: No, and I'm not going to waste men looking. We're fighting a war against
       your kind, and I intend to win it. You want to find him, try talking to
       anyone who'd meet a traveler. Innkeepers and carriage drivers in the big
       cities maybe. But you're on your own.

Serana: Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty
        big place.

        Do you have any ideas?
        Where would a Moth Priest actually go?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well, back before I...you know. The College of Winterhold was the
         first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing.
         The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably
         shouldn't know about.

         • Actually, now that I think of it...I'm going to come along with you.
           I've been really wanting to get out and explore a bit.

         • I'd...well, I'd come with you, but I don't know if I can trust your
           friend. Let me know if you want me along.

[There are many ways to find leads, such as those Harkon suggested. The most
 appropriate might be Serana's suggestion of the College, though, where one
 can ask the librarian.]

Dragonborn: I need to find a Moth Priest.

Urag gro-Shub: A Moth Priest? What in Oblivion do you want a Moth Priest for?

Dragonborn: My business is my own. Just tell me what I need to know.

Urag: Fine, fine. No need to get your breeches in a twist. The obvious answer
      is to go to the Imperial City. The Moth Priests make their home in the
      White Gold Tower. Sometimes they go out looking for Elder Scrolls. Lucky
      for you, there's a Moth Priest in Skyrim right now, doing just that. He
      stopped in to do some research in the library, then left for Dragon
      Bridge. If you hurry, you might catch him there.

[If one asks a carriage driver instead, they will all give the same answer:]

Dragonborn: Have you seen a Moth Priest?

Driver: That's one of them Imperial scholars, right? Old man with a gray robe?

Dragonborn: That's right. You've seen him?

Driver: Might be that I have, but I can't say for sure. I got enough troubles
        on my mind just tryin' to scrape by out here.

        Please, it's very important that I find him. (Persuade)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Now that I think on it, I did see your priest. He tried to hire me
           for a trip to Dragon Bridge, but I told him that ain't one of my
           stops.

         • Can't help you, friend. I might remember better if my pockets
           weren't so light.

        Maybe this will put your mind at ease. (### gold)
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Ah yes, I remember your Moth Priest now. He wanted me to take him
           out to Dragon Bridge, but I told him it ain't one of my stops.

         • An' maybe it won't.

        Never mind, I'll look somewhere else.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Suits me just fine.

[Some innkeepers may not be able to give information. Others, like Hulda in
 Whiterun or Corpulus Vinius in Solitude, will; they have the same dialogue
 as below.]

Dragonborn: Heard anything about a moth priest passing through?

Corpulus: Have I heard anything? It was the talk of the city for three days
          straight. Ain't too often we get a visitor like that.

Dragonborn: Where is he now?

Corpulus: Oh, he just left a short while ago. He said he'd finished up his
          work and it was time to move on. That's all I can tell you. He asked
          me not to let anyone know where he was going. I suppose he didn't
          want the attention.

          It's important that I find him right away. (Persuade)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           • Ah, well, in that case, I'll tell you what I know. He took the
             road southwest out of town, and he said he was going to be
             crossing over the Dragon Bridge. That's all he told me. I hope it
             helps.

           • It's like I said, I'm not going to talk about it.

          Finding that Moth Priest is worth a lot to me. (### gold)
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           • I can see that. He said he was heading for Dragon Bridge next. I
             hope that helps you.

           • Sorry, but that Moth Priest's comings and goings are none of my
             business, and none of yours either.

          I'll try my luck elsewhere.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Never much cared for folks who can't mind their own business.

[With the info found, one heads to Dragon Bridge. Across the titular landmark,
 one finds a waylaid cart and corpses, one of which contains a note mentioning
 Forebears' Holdout, where the kidnapped priest was taken. They creep toward
 the priest, captured in an ancient barrier, and questioned by a vampire.]

Malkus: The more you fight me, the more you will suffer, mortal.

Dexion: I will resist you, monster. I must!

Malkus: How much longer can you keep this up, Moth Priest? Your mind was
        strong, but you're exhausted from the struggle.

Dexion: Must... resist...

Malkus: Yes, I can feel your defenses crumbling. You want it to end. You want
        to give in to me. Now, acknowledge me as your master!

Dexion: Yes. master¹.

[They kill the vampires, then release Dexion. However, the bewitched priest is
 hostile, attacking immediately.]

Dexion: I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies will
        pay!

[He's soon defeated, snapping out of it.]

Dexion: Wait, stop! I yield! That...that wasn't me you were fighting. I could
        see through my eyes, but I could not control my actions. Thank you for
        breaking that foul vampire's hold over me.

Dragonborn: Are you alright?

Dexion: I'm quite alright, thanks to you. Dexion Evicus is my name. I'm a Moth
        Priest of the White Gold Tower. These vampires claimed they had some
        purpose in store for me, but they wouldn't say what. Probably holding
        me for ransom, the fools.

Dragonborn: I know why they needed you, because we need you for the same
            purpose.

Dexion: You do? Alright then, enough mysteries.

        We're called the Dawnguard, and we need you to read an Elder Scroll.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You have an Elder Scroll? Remarkable! If my knowledge of history
         serves me, I recall that the Dawnguard was an ancient order of vampire
         hunters. I will be happy to assist you with your Elder Scroll. Just
         tell me where I need to go.

        I'll explain later. Right now, we need your help and time is short.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well, you saved me from those vampires. I suppose the least I can do
         is hear you out.

Dragonborn: You can find us at Fort Dawnguard, near Stendarr's Beacon.

Dexion: Very well. I'll hurry on my way there before more of those vampires
        turn up.

[Everyone rendezvous at the Fort.]

Isran: I'm impressed you could find a Moth Priest so quickly.

Dragonborn: Does he have the Scroll? Is everything ready?

Isran: For the reading? Yeah. Just let the old man know when you're ready.

Dexion: Ah, hello there!

Dragonborn: Glad you made it here safely, Dexion.

Dexion: Ah, my rescuer! It's good to see you again.

Dragonborn: Have my companions made you feel welcome?

Dexion: It's not exactly the hospitality I'm used to, but your man Isran has
        seen to my needs well enough. And might I add, this is a remarkable
        fortress. I have colleagues back home that would love to study this
        place in detail.

Dragonborn: Are you prepared to read the Elder Scroll?

Dexion: Oh, most certainly! Let's find out what secrets the scroll can tell.
        Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must concentrate.

[He opens the legendary scroll.]

Dexion: I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon!
        It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying "Among the night's
        children, a dread lord will rise. In an age of strife, when dragons
        return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the
        night and day will be as one." The voice fades and the words begin to
        shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the
        bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the
        prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One
        contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of
        the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To
        know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls. I must
        rest now. The reading has made me weary.

Isran: Come on, old man. You should get some rest.

[After returning the Chalice to its proper place, one returns to Harkon.]

Harkon: Ah, you are here. Good.

Dragonborn: You wanted to speak to me?

Harkon: Yes, I did. When I told you that I was grateful for my daughter's safe
        return, I told the truth. But I did not tell you everything.

        I suspected as much.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Good. Strong instincts and a cunning mind will serve you as well as
         blade, spell or claw.

        When do you plan to start trusting me?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Do not presume to tell me who I can and cannot trust. I possess the
         wisdom of a dozen lifetimes, and I will make my own judgements. Now
         be silent, and hear what I have to say.

        As you know, vampires are powerful but we have limits. Our great enemy
        is the sun, and until recently it's an enemy we've had no way to fight.
        For centuries I searched for an answer to this problem. I found an old
        prophecy written by a Moth Priest, those scholars who read the Elder
        Scrolls. The prophecy tells of a time in which vampires will gain power
        over the sun, and will no longer fear its tyranny. I believe the secret
        to unraveling that prophecy is written in Serana's Elder Scroll. I have
        ordered the court to assemble. I have a new task for us all to carry
        out, and that includes you. Come now, and hear my proclamation.

[Harkon stands to address the other Volikhar vampires.]

Harkon: Scions of the night! Hear my words! The prophesied time is at last upon
        us. Soon we will claim dominion over the sun itself, and forge a new
        realm of eternal darkness. Now that I have reclaimed one of my Elder
        Scrolls, we must find a Moth Priest to read it. I have spread false
        rumors about the discovery of an Elder Scroll in Skyrim to lure a Moth
        Priest here. Now it is time to see if those efforts have borne fruit.
        Go forth, and search the land for rumors of a Moth Priest within our
        borders. Look to the cities. Speak to the innkeepers, carriage drivers,
        anyone who would meet a traveler. Go now, and carry out this task. This
        is my command!

Ronthil: A Moth Priest?

Garan: It will be done my lord!

Vingalmo: Hm. Most intriguing.

[Feran Sedri and Hestla run out immediately.]

Serana: Any idea on how you're going to find a Moth Priest? Skyrim's a pretty
        big place.

        Do you have any ideas?
        Where would a Moth Priest actually go?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well, back before I...you know. The College of Winterhold was the
         first place I'd think to go for any kind of magic or historical thing.
         The wizards know about all kinds of things that people probably
         shouldn't know about.

         • Actually, now that I think of it...I'm going to come along with you.
           I've been really wanting to get out and explore a bit.

         • I'd...well, I'd come with you, but I don't know if I can trust your
           friend. Let me know if you want me along.

[The methods of finding info are the same as in the Dawnguard version of this
 quest above; to avoid overlap, see that section for the clue-finding stuff.
 Either way, the info points to Dragon Bridge. Crossing the landmark bridge
 itself soon shows an overturned carriage and dead vampires around it. A note
 left behind mentions Forebears' Holdout. Inside, they sneak toward the large
 light barrier and overhear the Dawnguard talking.]

Dawnguard Lieutenant: Those vampires put up a hell of a fight."

Vanik: I just hope we weren't too late. I'm not sure what they did to this
       Moth Priest, but he doesn't look right.

D. Lieutenant: You think they turned him?

Vanik: I don't know, maybe. Won't know until we get him out of there.

D. Lieutenant: How do we do that?

Vanik: I'm working on it, now give me some silence so I can think.

[The player slaughters the former allies, takes the weystone focus from the
 corpse of Malkus, and removes the barrier. The Moth Priest emerges bewitched
 and angry.]

Dexion Evicus: I serve my master's will. But my master is dead, and his enemies
               will pay!

[One uses a vampiric seduction spell for calming, then feeds on him.]

Dexion: By the divines! It's as if my eyes have been opened! I am blinded by
        the light of your majesty. I...I must obey you. What would you have of
        me, master?

Dragonborn: I command you to travel to Castle Volkihar.

Dexion: Certainly. Where can I find this castle?

Dragonborn: Off the northern coast of Skyrim, due west of Solitude.

Dexion: I'll set out at once, then.

[The good news is soon reported to Harkon.]

Harkon: Well done! Somehow I knew it would be you and Serana who found our
        moth priest.

Dragonborn: I have made the Moth Priest my thrall.

Harkon: Yes, I see that. I trust his capture was not too difficult a task?

        The Dawnguard tried to stop me, but they posed no threat.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I wish I could have been there to hear the sounds of their screams.

        The Dawnguard were there. They fought well, but not well enough.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         They are determined and well-armed, but foolish if they think they
         can defy us. We will deal with them in time.

        The Dawnguard were protecting him, and they nearly killed me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         We both know that a band of fools with crossbows is no match for a
         scion of the ancient blood. I admit, I do not entirely understand
         your sense of humor.

        Well, your thrall awaits and we have given him the Elder Scroll.
        Command him to read it, and let us hear the words of prophecy together.

[One finds Dexion nearby.]

Dexion: Master, I have done as you asked and traveled here.

Dragonborn: I have a new task for you, thrall.

Dexion: Of course. What is it that you need me to do?

Dragonborn: You must read an Elder Scroll.

Dexion: Ah, yes, the Elder Scroll! I admit, I'm looking forward to this.

Dragonborn: Then you may begin your reading.

Dexion: Of course, master. Now, if everyone will please be quiet, I must
        concentrate.

[He takes out the legendary scroll.]

Dexion: I see a vision before me, an image of a great bow. I know this weapon!
        It is Auriel's Bow! Now a voice whispers, saying "Among the night's
        children, a dread lord will rise. In an age of strife, when dragons
        return to the realm of men, darkness will mingle with light and the
        night and day will be as one. The voice fades and the words begin to
        shimmer and distort. But wait, there is more here. The secret of the
        bow's power is written elsewhere. I think there is more to the
        prophecy, recorded in other scrolls. Yes, I see them now... One
        contains the ancient secrets of the dragons, and the other speaks of
        the potency of ancient blood. My vision darkens, and I see no more. To
        know the complete prophecy, we must have the other two scrolls.

Harkon: That was...not as useful as I would have liked. Even so, you did well.

Dragonborn: Do you know where these other scrolls are?

Harkon: My traitor wife stole one of them away and then disappeared. As for
        the other, the last that I heard, it was lost in the bowels of a
        Dwemer ruin. It seems our work is not yet done. But I have waited this
        long, and we are so very close now. I can wait a bit longer.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[After the crowd disperses following the Scroll's reading, Serana approaches.
 The quests from now on will be shared by Dawnguard and vampire alike, so some
 options may only make sense or appear based off that.]

Serana: Do you have a moment to talk?

        What's on your mind?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That Moth Priest, Dexion. He said we needed two other Elder Scrolls.
         I think I know where we can start looking.

        Can't it wait?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Well, you could waste a lot of time trying to figure out our next
         move, or you could let me help. Your choice.

        Why didn't you say something earlier?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Didn't want that lot getting wind of it. Especially my father.
         • Half the people in your little crew would just as soon kill me as
           talk to me. That doesn't exactly make me want to open up. I got a
           warmer welcome from my father, and that's saying something.

        What is it between the two of you?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ever since he decided to make that prophecy his calling, we kind of
         drifted apart.

        Do you trust Harkon at all?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         It's not a question of trust...he's just obsessed with the prophecy.
         And from what I can tell, an thousand extra years of obsession haven't
         made him any better. We should have found him a hobby.

        Does Harkon even care about you anymore?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You know, I've asked myself the same thing. I¹ thought¹...I hoped that
         if he saw me, he might feel something again. But I guess I don't
         really factor in at this point.

        I don't think he even sees me as his daughter anymore. I'm just...a
        means to an end.

Dragonborn: So where is this Elder Scroll?

Serana: We need to find my mother, Valerica. She'll definitely know where it
        is, and if we're lucky, she actually has it herself.

Dragonborn: You said you didn't know where she went.

Serana: The last time I saw her, she said that she'd go somewhere safe...
        somewhere that my father would never search. Other than that, she
        wouldn't tell me anything. But the way she said it..."someplace he'd
        never search." It was cryptic, yet she called attention to it.

        Sounds like she was being cautious.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Maybe. What I can't figure out is why she said it that way.

        We can't waste time on cryptic clues.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         If you have a better lead than this, I'm all ears.

        Maybe your mother didn't trust you, either.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's always a possibility. She was almost as obsessed as my father
         by the time she shut me in. But I can't worry about that now. We need
         the scroll, and she's our only lead.

        Besides, I can't imagine a single place my father would avoid looking.
        And he's had all this time, too. Any ideas?

        Hiding with the Dawnguard?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • I doubt my mother would waste her time with those fools. They
           probably would have tried to kill her, and that has a way of souring
           relationships. Any other ideas?

         • They'd be even less welcoming to her than they've been to me. It
           would have been a bloodbath. And since the Dawnguard are still
           around, that must not have happened. Any other ideas?

        Sealed away like you were?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I don't think so. She said she wanted to stay awake in case the
         situation was resolved. It had to be one of us, and, well, she's so
         much more powerful than I am. It just made sense for her to be out
         there. Anything else?

        How about right here, in the castle?² / In Castle Volkihar?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Wait...that almost makes sense!

         • I used to help my mother tend a garden in the courtyard here.
         • There's a courtyard in the castle. I used to help her tend a garden
           there.

        All of the ingredients for our potions came from there. She used to say
        that my father couldn't stand the place. Too...peaceful.

Dragonborn: Isn't that pretty risky, staying around the castle?

Serana: Oh, absolutely. But my mother's not a coward. That is...I don't think
        we'll actually trip over her there. But it's worth a look.

        How can we get in without your father noticing?²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Trust me. I lived here for a very long time and I know every nook and
         cranny. 

        They aren't going to let us use the front door.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         True. But I know a way we can get to the courtyard without arousing
         suspicion.

        There's an unused inlet on the northern side of the island that was
        used by the previous owners to bring supplies into the castle. An old
        escape tunnel from the castle exits there. I think that's our way in.

        Let's go to the castle's secret entrance.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • Come on. It's just around the side.
         • It's around the side of the castle. Let's move.
         • Well, I don't take just anyone into the secret parts of the place
           I grew up. Get rid of this interloper and you and I can be on our
           way. I'll wait for you at the dock.

        Actually, I have some things to do first.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Don't let me stand in your way, then. I'll be at the dock whenever
         you're ready.

[The two walk the Volkihar shore clockwise toward the inlet.]

Serana: Yeah, just around this bend. Castle looks so big from down here. I
        mean, it is big, but, well, even bigger.

[Together, the player and Serana enter the deserted undercroft.]

Serana: The old water cistern. One some days, this smell would just...be glad
        you weren't here then. Take a left up here. This is one of those weird
        double-barred security measures that my father put in when he got more
        paranoid. If we follow that path around, we can find the other switch.
        This leads out to the courtyard. Just head for the door.

[They continue on, eventually reaching the old garden, now gone to seed.]

Serana: We've made it to the courtyard. Oh no... What happened to this place?
        Everything's been torn down... The whole place looks...well, dead. It's
        like we're the first to set foot here in centuries. This used to lead
        into the castle's great hall. It looks like my father had it sealed up.
        I used to walk through here after evening meals. It was beautiful,
        once. This was my mother's garden. It...do you know how beautiful
        something can be when it's tended by a master for hundreds of years?
        She would have hated to see it like this. Wait... Something's wrong
        with the moondial here. Some of the crests are missing and the dial is
        askew. I didn't even know the crests could be removed. Maybe my
        mother's trying to tell us something? I'm telling you, there's
        something strange with the moondial.

[The player can inquire further.]

Dragonborn: What happened to the castle courtyard?

Serana: If I had to guess, I'd say the moment mother fled the castle, father
        went on a rampage. Knowing him, anything at all that reminded him of
        her was just destroyed.

Dragonborn: Then he just walled it off.

Serana: It appears that way. I suppose he wanted to put the past behind him.
        Perhaps if he had spent more time with us, he would have recognized
        the beauty for himself.

Dragonborn: What's so special about the moondial?

Serana: Well, as far as I'm aware it's the only one in existence. The previous
        owners of the castle had a sundial in the courtyard, and obviously
        that didn't appeal to my mother. She persuaded an elven artisan to make
        some improvements. You can see the plates that show the phases of the
        moons, Masser and Secunda.

Dragonborn: Does it work?

Serana: That's the thing...what's the point of a moondial? I always wondered
        why she didn't just have the whole thing ripped out. But she loved it.
        I don't know. I guess it's like having a piece of art, if you're into
        that sort of thing.

Dragonborn: So what exactly am I doing to it?

Serana: Hard to say. Maybe if we found the missing crests, we could figure it
        out. Look around for the missing crests. Even in this mess, they should
        stick out.

[The player finds the crest, then places them correctly. The sundial reveals
 a hidden stairway below it.]

Serana: Very clever, mother. Very clever. I've never been in those tunnels
        before, but I'd bet they run right under the courtyard and into the
        tower ruins. Well, at least we're getting closer. Let's go.

[They pull a hidden wall back with a lever, revealing a bloody kitchen.]

Serana: I've never even seen this part of the castle before. Be careful. I
        don't know what might be around.

[They continue through the ancient halls, constantly ascending.]

Serana: I don't think we've reached the top yet. I'd bet there's some kind of
        secret passage around here.

[They find a path behind the fireplace.]

Serana: Leave it to my mother...always smarter than I gave her credit for.

[They reach the tower's apex, Valerica's old laboratory.]

Serana: Look at this place. This has to be it! I knew she was deep into
        necromancy. I mean, she taught me everything I know. But I had no idea
        she had a setup like this. Look at all this. She must have spent years
        collecting these components. And what's this thing?

[She looks at a floor indentation with many concentric circles.]

Serana: I'm not sure about this circle, but it's obviously...something. Let's
        take a look around. There has to be something here that tells us where
        she's gone.

        Do you think this would help? (Give journal)²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You've found her journal! Let me take a look at it. (jump to "What's
         this "Soul Cairn"...")

        What exactly are we looking for?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         My mother was meticulous about her research. If we can find her notes,
         there might be some hints in there.

        Did your mother keep gargoyles here?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Not that I ever saw. My mother had a bit of a thing for magical
         constructs. Not...not what you're thinking. She just found them
         fascinating.

        Your mother maintained quite a laboratory.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I had no idea that her laboratory even existed. She had an alchemy
         setup in her drawing room, but nothing that even comes close to what's
         here.

         What did she research?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Looking at the equipment and materials, it looks like she was trying
          to advance her necromancy.

          To what end?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I don't know. Certainly not longevity. Kind of a waste of time for
           a vampire.

        I remember she used to keep a small journal. See if you can dig it up.

[A journal is found on a shelf.]

Dragonborn: I've found your mother's notes.

Serana: You did? Let me see them.

Dragonborn: What's this "Soul Cairn" that she mentions?

Serana: I only know what she told me. She had a theory about soul gems. That
        the souls inside of them don't just vanish when they're used...they
        end up in the Soul Cairn.

Dragonborn: Why did she care where used souls went?

Serana: The Soul Cairn is home to very powerful beings. Necromancers send them
        souls, and receive powers of their own in return. My mother spent a lot
        of time trying to contact them directly, to travel to the Soul Cairn
        itself.

Dragonborn: If she made it there, we'll find her.

Serana: That circle in the center of the room is definitely some type of
        portal. If I'm reading this right, there's a formula here that should
        give us safe passage into the Soul Cairn.

Dragonborn: What do we need?

Serana: A handful of soul gem shards, some finely-ground bone meal, a good bit
        of purified void salts... Oh...damn it...

Dragonborn: What's wrong?

Serana: We're also going to need a sample of her blood. Which...if we could
        get that, we wouldn't even be trying to do this in the first place.

Dragonborn: You share her blood.

Serana: Hmmm. Not bad. We'd better hope that's good enough. Mistakes with these
        kinds of portals can be...gruesome. Anyway, enough of that. Let's get
        started.

        Are all of those ingredients here?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, definitely. Mother would have plenty of those materials in her
         laboratory, you just need to find them.

        I already found all of the ingredients.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, good. Well then...let's head over to the portal vessel and I'll
         do the rest.

[The player collects the items and puts them in the vessel.]

Serana: Then the rest is up to me. Are you ready to go? I'm not entirely sure
        what this thing is going to do when I add my blood.

        Can I ask you something first?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Of course. What is it?

         What will you do if we find your mother?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I've been asking myself the same thing since we came back to the
          castle. She was so sure of what we did to my father, I couldn't help
          but go along with her. I never thought of the cost.

          It sounds like she did everything for your sake.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Possibly. I guess even a vampire mother is still a mother. She
           worried about me. About all of us. But she wanted to get me as far
           away from my father as possible before he really went over the edge.

          I don't know what she was thinking.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Neither do I. She always seemed happy, before we heard the prophecy.
           Then it all changed. She became a different person. They both did.

          It sounds like she was pretty selfish.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           She wasn't, always. But I think you're right. She was practically
           smirking as we left home. Almost like she was proud of herself. Like
           she didn't just want to stop my father...she wanted to stick it to
           him, too.

           We won't know until we find her.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Yes...yes, you're right. I'm sorry. I just didn't expect anyone to
            care how I felt about her. Thank you. Are we ready then?

            Let's get that portal open.
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             All right. Here goes.

        I have some preparations to make, first.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I'll be here. Don't take too long, now!

        I'm ready.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Okay, here goes.
         
[Putting the blood in the vessel opens an otherworldly portal.]

Serana: By the blood of my ancestors... She actually did it...created a portal
        to the Soul Cairn. Incredible.

[If one isn't a vampire, the Soul Cairn portal rejects the player.]

Serana: Are you alright? That looked painful.

Dragonborn: It was. What happened?

Serana: Now that I think about it...I should have expected that. Sorry. It's
        hard to describe. The Soul Cairn is...well, hungry, for lack of a
        better word. It's trying to take your life essence as payment.

Dragonborn: So there's no way in, then.

Serana: There might be, but I don't think you're going to like it. Vampires
        aren't counted among the living. I could probably go through there
        without a problem.

Dragonborn: Are you saying that I need to become a vampire?

Serana: Not your first choice, I'd guess.

Dragonborn: There has to be another way.

Serana: Maybe. We could just "pay the toll" another way. It wants a soul, so
        we give it a soul. Yours.

Dragonborn: Wouldn't that kill me?

Serana: My mother taught me a trick or two. I could partially soul trap you,
        and offer that gem to the Ideal Masters. It might be enough to satisfy
        them. It would make you a bit weaker when we travel through the Soul
        Cairn, but we might be able to fix that once we're inside. Maybe.

Dragonborn: Those are my only options?

Serana: I'm sorry. I wish I knew a better way, something that would be easier
        for you. Just know that...whatever path you choose, I won't think any
        less of you. Sometimes things just have to be done. I know that better
        than anybody.

[If one decides to become a vampire to gain entry:]

Dragonborn: I don't see another way. I'll become a vampire.

Serana: Are you sure? I'm willing to turn you, but you need to think it
        through. You'd become the very thing you'd sworn to destroy. I don't
        know how the Dawnguard will react.

        You're right. Let me think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I understand. Take your time.

        I'm ready.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Turning someone is a very...personal thing for vampires. It's
         intimate. For us. I don't want you to feel like I'm forcing you into
         this.

         In that case, I'm glad you're the one doing it.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Let's not waste too much time, then.

         I understand.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Good.

         Let's just get it over with.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          As you wish.

         I promise to try and make this as painless as possible. Hold still.

[If one decides to get soul trapped to gain entry:]

Dragonborn: Soul trap me. I won't feel right as a vampire.

Serana: Are you sure? I'm willing to do it, but you need to think it through.
        You'll remain mortal, but you'll find yourself weakened within the
        Soul Cairn.

        You're right. Let me think about it.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I understand. Take your time.

        I'm ready.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I know this is difficult for you. I hope you trust me. I'd never do
         anything that could hurt you.

         I trust you completely.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Thank you.

         Don't worry about it.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Oh. Good.

         Let's just get this over with.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          As you wish.

         I promise to make this as painless as possible. Hold still. Let's go.
         My mother must be waiting on the other side of that thing.

[Once one is soul-trapped or vampirized, the team can finally descend the
 steps into the magnificent new location.]

[DW07] SCROLL SCOUTING |=======================================================
_______________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[With one Scroll in hand, and one apparently in Valerica's hands, it's time to
 track down the third's whereabouts. The College is the suggested destination,
 as before. One seeks out the librarian.]

Dragonborn: I'm looking for an Elder Scroll.

Urag: And what do you plan to do with it? Do you even know what you're asking
      about? 

      Tell me more about the Elder Scrolls.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       I knew it. Everyone comes in here, expecting my help, but they don't
       even have the proper questions. An Elder Scroll is an instrument of
       immense knowledge and power. To read an Elder Scroll, a person must
       have the most rigorously trained mind, or else risk madness. Even so,
       the Divines usually take the reader's sight as a price.

       A price for what?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        The simplest way to put it is "knowledge," but there's nothing simple
        about an Elder Scroll. It's a reflection of all possible futures and
        all possible pasts. Each reader sees different reflections through
        different lenses, and may come away with a very different reading. But
        at the same time, all of it is true. Even the falsehoods. Especially
        the falsehoods.

       Who wrote the Elder Scrolls?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        It would take a month to explain to you how that very question doesn't
        even make sense. The Scrolls exist here, with us, but are also beyond
        and beneath. Before and after. They are bits of Divine made substance
        so we could know them. Sorry. Talking about the Scrolls, you usually
        end up in irritating and vague metaphors like that. Some people who
        study them devoutly go mad.

       All right. So do you have one that I could use?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Ha!

      Of course I do. Do you have one here?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       You think even if I did have one here, I would let you see it? It would
       be kept under the highest security. The greatest thief in the world
       wouldn't be able to lay a finger on it. 

       Do you at least have any information on them?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Of course.

       I need to find one and was told you could help.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I don't know who told you that, but I'll do what I can. What we do have
        are plenty of books.

      I'll bring you everything we have on them, but it's not much. So don't
      get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture.

[He gets out a book written by Septimus Signus.]

Dragonborn: This "Ruminations" book is incomprehensible.

Urag: Aye, that's the work of Septimus Signus. He's the world's master on the
      nature of Elder Scrolls, but...well. He's been gone for a long while.
      Too long.

      Where did he go?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Somewhere up north, in the ice fields. Said he found some old Dwemer
       artifact, but...well, that was years ago. Haven't heard from him since.

      He's dead?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Oh no. I hope not. But even I haven't seen him in years, and we were
       close. Became obsessed with the Dwemer. Took off north saying he had
       found some old artifact. Haven't seen him since. Somewhere in the ice
       fields, if you want to try and find him.

[At this point, the quest ends, and "Discerning the Transmundane" begins. It's
 a completely different quest unrelated to the Dawnguard, but it needs to be
 done to find the scroll. See that section for relevant details.]

[The player and Serana enter the Soul Cairn, a dark, twisted landscape with
 many old ruins and buildings dotting the landscape. Lost souls roam around
 the fog-covered area.]

Serana: • Let's keep moving. I feel like we're being watched.
        • I'd heard stories about the Soul Cairn, but never thought I'd see it
          myself. So far it's...about what I imagined.

[They make for a far-off castle with twin energy spires. There, one finds a
 barrier preventing entrance. Valerica is trapped on the other side.]

Serana: Mother!

Valerica: Maker...it can't be. Serana?!

Serana: Is it really you? I can't believe it! How do we get inside? We have to
        talk.

Valerica: Serana? What are you doing here? Where's your father?

Serana: He doesn't know we're here. I don't have time to explain.

Valerica: I must have failed. Harkon's found a way to decipher the prophecy,
          hasn't he.¹

Serana: No, you've got it all wrong. We're here to complete the prophecy our
        way, not his.

Valerica: Wait a moment...you've brought a stranger here? Have you lost your
          mind?

Serana: No, you don't...

Valerica: You. Come forward. I would speak with you.

          • So how has it come to pass that a vampire of mixed blood is in the
            company of my daughter?
          • So how has it come to pass that a vampire hunter is in the company
            of my daughter? It pains me to think you'd travel with Serana under
            the guise her protector in an effort to hunt me down.

          I've been keeping her safe.²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Safe? You call bringing her here safe? Has she explained nothing to
           you?

          This is no ruse. I want to keep her safe.²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Coming from one who murders vampires as a trade, I find it hard to
           believe your intentions are noble.

          I've saved her from your foolish plan.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I find your choice of words quite interesting considering that
           Serana is in far more danger now than she was following my "foolish
           plan."

          I'm just here for the Elder Scroll.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Glorious. Serana claims you're her guardian, yet your first instinct
           appears to be greed. I see that my daughter is still as naive as
           ever.

          Serana has sacrificed everything to prevent Harkon from completing
          the prophecy. I would have expected her to explain that to you.

Dragonborn: That's why I'm here for the Elder Scroll.

Valerica: You think I'd have the audacity to place my own daughter in that
          tomb for the protection of her Elder Scroll alone? The scrolls are
          merely a means to an end. The key to the Tyranny of the Sun is Serana
          herself.

Dragonborn: What do you mean?

Valerica: When I fled Castle Volkihar, I fled with two Elder Scrolls. The
          scroll I presume you found with Serana speaks of Auriel and his
          arcane weapon, Auriel's Bow. The second scroll declares that "The
          Blood of Coldharbour's Daughter will blind the eye of the Dragon."

Dragonborn: How does Serana fit in?

Valerica: Like myself, Serana was a human once. We were devout followers of
          Lord Molag Bal. Tradition dictates the females be offered to Molag
          Bal on his summoning day. Few survive the ordeal. Those that do
          emerge as a pure-blooded vampire. We call such confluences the
          "Daughters of Coldharbour."

          The Tyranny of the Sun requires Serana's blood?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Now you're beginning to see why I wanted to protect Serana, and why
           I've kept the other Elder Scroll as far from her as possible.

          Serana underwent this ritual willingly?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           It was expected of her, just as it was expected of me. Being
           selected as an offering to Molag Bal is an honor. She wouldn't have
           dared turn her back on that.

          Coldharbour?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           It's what some call the domain of Molag Bal. His place in Oblivion.

Dragonborn: Are you saying Harkon means to kill her?

Valerica: If Harkon obtained Auriel's Bow and Serana's blood was used to taint
          the weapon, the Tyranny of the Sun would be complete. In his eyes,
          she'd be dying for the good of all vampires.

Dragonborn: I would never allow that to happen.

Valerica: And how exactly do you plan on completing the prophecy without the
          death of my daughter?

          I'll kill Harkon.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           If you believe that, then you're a bigger fool than I originally
           suspected. Don't you think I weighed that option before I enacted
           my plans?

          I'll need your help.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Have you been listening to me? Like Serana, I'm a pure-blooded
           vampire. My presence on Tamriel is as much of a danger as hers is.

          Perhaps her death is destined.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           No! I will not allow that to happen. The Elder Scrolls only tell of
           events that might be, not events that will be.

Dragonborn: And Serana's opinion on this?

Valerica: You care nothing for Serana or our plight.
 
          • You see the Tyranny of the Sun as your chance at deification, and
            like Harkon you won't hesitate to destroy anything that stands in
            your path.

          • Whether or not you've become one of us in order to survive the
            Soul Cairn, you're still a vampire hunter at heart. You're here
            because we're abominations in your mind. Evil creatures that need
            to be destroyed.

          Serana believes in me, why won't you?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           • Serana? This stranger may call himself vampire, but he knows
            nothing of our struggle. Why should I entrust you to him?

           • This stranger aligns himself with those who would hunt you down
             and slay you like an animal, yet I should entrust you to him?

          I'm just here for the Elder Scroll.²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I see. You're simply here to stop the Tyranny of the Sun, despite
           the cost to Serana. Nothing else matters.

Serana: This "stranger" has done more for me in the brief time I've known him
        than you've done in centuries!

Valerica: How dare you! I gave up everything I cared about to protect you from
          that fanatic you call a father!

Serana: Yes, he's a fanatic...he's changed. But he's still my father. Why can't
        you understand how that makes me feel?

Valerica: Oh, Serana. If you'd only open your eyes. The moment your father
          discovers your role in the prophecy, that he needs your blood, you'd
          be in terrible danger.

Serana: So to protect me, you decided to shut me away from everything I cared
        about? You never asked me if hiding in that tomb was the best course
        of action, you just expected me to follow you blindly. Both of you were
        obsessed with your own paths. Your motivations might have been
        different, but in the end, I'm still just a pawn to you, too. I want
        us to be a family again. But I don't know if we can ever have that.
        Maybe we don't deserve that kind of happiness. Maybe it isn't for us.
        But we have to stop him. Before he goes too far. And to do that, we
        need the Elder Scroll.

Valerica: I'm sorry, Serana. I didn't know...I didn't see. I've allowed my
          hatred of your father to estrange us for too long. Forgive me. If you
          want the Elder Scroll, it's yours.

[She turns to the player.]

Valerica: Your intentions are still somewhat unclear to me. But for Serana's
          sake, I'll assist you in any way that I can.

Dragonborn: Do you have the Elder Scroll with you?

Valerica: Yes. I've kept it safely secured here ever since I was imprisoned.

          • Fortunately, you seem to have already killed the Keepers
            maintaining the barrier around these ruins.

            Does that mean you can take us to it now?²
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Yes. Please, follow me. One more word of warning. There's a dragon
             that calls itself Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. The Ideal Masters
             have charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly
             investigate the fact that the barrier has fallen.

          • Fortunately, you're in a position to breach the barrier that
            surrounds these ruins.

Dragonborn: What do we need to do?

Valerica: You need to locate the tallest of the rocky spires that surround
          these ruins. At their bases, the barrier's energy is being drawn from
          unfortunate souls that have been exiled here. Destroy the Keepers
          that are tending them, and it should bring the barrier down.

Dragonborn: We'll return soon.

Valerica: One more word of warning. There's a dragon that calls itself
          Durnehviir roaming the Cairn. Be wary of him. The Ideal Masters have
          charged him with overseeing the Keepers, and will undoubtedly
          intervene if you're perceived as a threat. Be careful, and keep my
          daughter safe.

Serana: Let's kill those...Keeper things and get back to the prison.

[One can ask further questions.]

Dragonborn: How did you become imprisoned here?

Valerica: When I entered the Soul Cairn, I had intended to strike a bargain
          with the Ideal Masters, the custodians of this place.

Dragonborn: What was the bargain?

Valerica: I requested refuge in the Soul Cairn, and in exchange, I would
          provide the Ideal Masters the souls that they craved. If I had
          foreseen the value they placed on my own soul, I would never have
          come here.

Dragonborn: They tricked you.

Valerica: The Ideal Masters unleashed their Keepers and sent them to destroy
          me. Fortunately, I was able to hold them at bay and retreat into
          these ruins.

Dragonborn: You became trapped.

Valerica: Unfortunately, yes. Since the Keepers weren't able to claim my soul,
          they had their minions construct a barrier that I'd never be able to
          breach.

Dragonborn: You've been imprisoned here for all this time?

Valerica: Time has very little meaning to me. Consequently, it has little
          meaning to the Ideal Masters as well. I suppose you could call this
          the ultimate waiting game, each watching the other to see which will
          give in.

Dragonborn: If I leave the Soul Cairn, can I safely return?

Valerica: As you've been traveling in the Soul Cairn, your body has become
          attuned to it. Let's just say a tiny part of you rubbed off on it,
          and in its place, a bit of the Soul Cairn filled the void. You
          should find no difficulty using the portal any longer.

Dragonborn: Why haven't you pursued the prophecy?

Valerica: Harkon's vision is a world plunged in eternal darkness where the
          vampire can flourish and never again fear the "tyranny of the sun."
          What he fails to realize is how much attention would be called to
          our kind if the prophecy came to fruition.

Dragonborn: What sort of attention?

Valerica: If eternal night fell, there are many who wouldn't stand for it. They
          would raise armies in attempts to return things to normal. The order
          of the day would be our destruction until every last vampire was
          hunted down and eliminated.

Dragonborn: So you prefer living in the shadows.

Valerica: I do. It's how the vampire has survived for millennia, and the only
          way we can continue to survive in the future.

Dragonborn: Who are the Ideal Masters?

Valerica: I know very little about them. They're mystic entities that lord over
          the Soul Cairn, controlling every aspect from its fabric to its
          appearance.

Dragonborn: What do they resemble?

Valerica: Well, some necromancers believe they are the crystalline structures
          dotting the Soul Cairn. I believe there's more to it than that.

Dragonborn: How so?

Valerica: I think they transcend what we perceive as a physical form. Perhaps
          they were once corporeal beings, but they've obviously reached a
          point where they no longer require a tangible presence.

Dragonborn: And the crystals?

Valerica: Conduits through which the Ideal Masters speak to their underlings
          and feed on their victims.

Dragonborn: Why would they require sustenance?

Valerica: The Ideal Masters's weakness is their insatiable hunger for pure
          souls. It's the reason for the Soul Cairn's existence, and the only
          leverage a necromancer has when bargaining with them.

Dragonborn: What do the Masters provide in return?

Valerica: The ability to summon powerful undead guardians as one would conjure
          an atronach or daedra. However, the majority of necromancers that are
          foolish enough to enter into a bargain with the Ideal Masters wind up
          here...as harvested souls.

[The player slays three Keepers, dispelling the barrier.]

Valerica: You managed to destroy all three Keepers? Very impressive.

Dragonborn: Are you able to give us the scroll now?

Valerica: Yes. Please, follow me. Keep watch for Durnehviir. With the prison's
          barrier down, he's almost certain to investigate.

[They enter the prison's large courtyard.]

Serana: Wait...I hear something!

Valerica: It's Durnehviir...he's here! Defend yourselves!

[They fight the ancient dragon, fending off the skeletons his powers start to
 resurrect. Eventually, they stamp out his attacks.]

Valerica: Forgive my astonishment, but I never thought I'd witness the death
          of that dragon.

Dragonborn: What makes you say that?

Valerica: Volumes written on Durnehviir allege that he can't be slain by normal
          means. It appears they were mistaken. Unless...

Dragonborn: Go on.

Valerica: The soul of a dragon is as resilient as its owner's scaly hide. It's
          possible that your killing blow merely displaced Durnehviir's
          physical form while he reconstitutes himself.

Dragonborn: How long will that take?

Valerica: Minutes? Hours? Years? I can't even begin to guess. I suggest we
          don't wait around to find out. Now, let's get your Elder Scroll and
          you can be on your way.

Serana: Come on, she's leading us to the scroll.

[They find a sheltered alcove across the courtyard. One takes the scroll from
 an ornate box.]

Serana: That's it. That's the last scroll. Come on, let's take it to Dexion.

Valerica: Now that you've retrieved the Elder Scroll, you should be on your
          way. If there's anything I can do before you depart, you must let
          me know.

          Can you help me get my soul back?²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           So my daughter applied some of the lessons I taught her about
           necromancy, did she? Don't worry, I think I can help you.

           Good, I could use all the help I can get.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Your soul essence was trapped inside a gem. When you and Serana
            entered the Soul Cairn, it was "given" to the Ideal Masters as
            payment. You simply need to retrieve the gem. The moment you touch
            it, your soul essence will be restored.

            Any idea where it could be?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             There's an offering altar not terribly far from here. I'm willing
             to bet that the gem you're looking for is there. Is there anything
             else? Could be your last chance.

          You're staying here?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I have no choice. As I told you before, I'm a Daughter of
           Coldharbour. If I return to Tamriel, that increases Harkon's
           likelihood of bringing the Tyranny of the Sun to fruition.

           We'll return for you when we can.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            I appreciate your concern for me, but Serana is all I care about.
            You must keep her safe at all costs.

           We could use your help in Tamriel.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            As much as it pains me to send you and Serana back alone, I can't
            take the risk.

           We may never return.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            After what I've put Serana through, I would understand if she never
            wished to see me again. I leave that decision in your hands.

          Remember that Harkon is not to be trusted. No matter what he
          promises, he'll deceive you in order to get what he wants. And
          promise me you'll keep my daughter safe. She's the only thing of
          value I have left. Farewell. Remember that Harkon's not to be
          trusted.

Serana: I'm glad we found the scroll, but I...I wish she could come with us.

[Dragonborn can inquire further.]

Dragonborn: Why don't you come back with us?

Valerica: Even if I could, it would only serve to hinder your efforts. Harkon
          would likely sense my return to Tamriel. The last thing you need
          right now is a trail for him to follow.

Dragonborn: You said "even if I could." Why?

Valerica: Like Serana, I am a Daughter of Coldharbour, an¹ vampire offspring of
          Molag Bal. My presence in Tamriel would simply double the risk that
          Harkon could complete the prophecy.

Dragonborn: And if Harkon failed?

Valerica: The only way I'd even consider returning to Tamriel was if Harkon
          were not only to fail, but to be destroyed.

Dragonborn: You hate him that much?

Valerica: You must understand that he's no longer the man I married all that
          time ago. He's obsessed...insane. Everyone around him fears him as
          they would a rabid dog. For all of this to end, he must die.

[They exit the boneyard, only to find Durnehviir's spectral form waiting.]

Durnehviir: Stay your weapons. I would speak with you, Qahnaarin.

Dragonborn: I thought you were dead.

Durnehviir: Cursed, not dead. Doomed to exist in this form for all eternity.
            Trapped between laas and dinok, between life and death.

            Why are we speaking?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             I believe in civility among seasoned warriors, and I find your ear
             worthy of my words. My claws have rended flesh from innumerable
             foes, but I have never once been felled on the field of battle.
             I therefore honor-name you "Qahnaarin," or Vanquisher in your
             tongue.

             I found you equally worthy.
             ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
              Your words do me great honor. My desire to speak with you was
              born from the result of our battle, Qahnaarin. I merely wish to
              respectfully ask a favor of you.

            Didn't you try to kill me?
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             The hostility was necessary. I was bound to an oath.

            I have more pressing matters at the moment.
            ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
             Forgive me, Qahnaarin. We will continue this when time releases
             you from its relentless grasp.

Dragonborn: What kind of favor?

Durnehviir: For countless years I've roamed the Soul Cairn, in unintended
            service to the Ideal Masters. Before this, I roamed the skies above
            Tamriel. I desire to return there.

Dragonborn: What's stopping you?

Durnehviir: I fear that my time here has taken its toll on me. I share a bond
            with this dreaded place. If I ventured far from the Soul Cairn, my
            strength would begin to wane until I was no more.

Dragonborn: How could I help?

Durnehviir: I will place my name with you and grant you the right to call my
            name from Tamriel. Do me this simple honor and I will fight at your
            side as your Grah-Zeymahzin, your Ally, and teach you my Thu'um.

Dragonborn: Just call your name in Tamriel? That's it?

Durnehviir: Trivial in your mind, perhaps. For me, it would mean a great deal.
            I don't require an answer, Qahnaarin. Simply speak my name to the
            heavens when you feel the time is right.

[He teaches his thu'um. One can inquire further.]

Dragonborn: Why do you call me "Qahnaarin"?

Durnehviir: In my language, the Qahnaarin is the Vanquisher, the one who has
            bested a fellow dovah in battle.

Dragonborn: Fellow dovah? I am not a dragon.
            
Durnehviir: Forgive me, my instinct was to grant you this title. I am uncertain
            why. Perhaps one day it will become clear to both of us.

Dragonborn: How did you end up in the Soul Cairn?

Durnehviir: There was a time when I called Tamriel my home, but those days have
            long since passed. The dovah roamed the skies, vying for their
            small slices of territory that resulted in immense and ultimately
            fatal battles.

Dragonborn: Were you a part of all that?

Durnehviir: I was. But unlike some of my brethren, I sought solutions outside
            the norm in order to maintain my superiority. I began to explore
            what the dovah call "Alok-Dilon," the ancient forbidden art that
            you call necromancy.

Dragonborn: So you sought the Soul Cairn for answers.

Durnehviir: The Ideal Masters assured me that my powers would be unmatched,
            that I could raise legions of the undead. In return, I was to serve
            them as a Keeper until the death of the one who calls herself
            Valerica.

Dragonborn: They didn't tell you she was immortal.

Durnehviir: I discovered too late that the Ideal Masters favor deception over
            honor and had no intention of releasing me from my binding. They
            had control of my mind, but fortunately they couldn't possess my
            soul.

Dragonborn: Is that why you're free now?

Durnehviir: Free? No. I've been here too long, Qahnaarin. The Soul Cairn has
            become a part of what I am. I can never fully call Tamriel my home
            again, or I would surely perish. I only hope that you will allow me
            the precious moments of time there through your call.

[After hearing the necrodragon's words, it's back to Castle Volkihar...]

[The team emerges from the Cairn.]

Serana: The sooner we get the scroll home, the sooner we can deal with my
        father.

#################### IF ON D'GUARD SIDE ####################

Dexion: I trust your journey was successful?

Dragonborn: I've brought the Elder Scrolls.

Dexion: I'm sorry, my friend. I can no longer be of use in this matter.

Dragonborn: Why? What's happened?

Dexion: It's my fault. In my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the
        careful preparation required. I thought I'd be able to allay the
        after effects¹, but I was wrong. Now I'm paying for it.

Dragonborn: That covering on your eyes. Are you--

Dexion: Blind? Yes. I'm afraid so.

Dragonborn: Can anything be done to help you?

Dexion: No. It'll have to run its course, and there's always the chance I may
        never recover.

Dragonborn: Then we're finished.

Dexion: No, there's another way. The question is, how much are you willing to
        risk to find Auriel's Bow?

Dragonborn: What do I need to do?

Dexion: I can't guarantee you'll be free from harm. Becoming blind could be the
        least of your worries.

Dragonborn: Don't worry about that. Just tell me.

#################### IF ON VAMPIRE SIDE ####################

[They return to Dexion, who now appears with a blindfold.]

Dexion: Yes, how may I serve you, milord?

Dragonborn: I've brought the Elder Scrolls.

Dexion: I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with the scrolls any longer,
        milord. Please, do not be angry with me.

Dragonborn: What are you talking about?

Dexion: I'm afraid in my haste to read the first scroll, I neglected the time
        I needed to prepare. The failure is purely mine to bear. As you can
        see from my bandages, it's not that I'm unwilling, it is that I'm
        physically unable.

Dragonborn: You're blind!

Dexion: Oh please, milord! Please...forgive me!

Dragonborn: I don't suppose there's a cure.

Dexion: If only such a miracle existed, I'd overcome the impossible in order
        to secure it if it meant pleasing you.

Dragonborn: Then we have no further need of you.

Dexion: Although I would gladly die by your hand, perhaps I could offer an
        alternative way to read the scrolls?

Dragonborn: Go on.

Dexion: Oh thank you, milord. Thank you!

Dragonborn: Just get to it!

#################### PATHS REJOIN AT THIS POINT ####################

Dexion: Scattered across Tamriel are secluded locations known only as Ancestor
        Glades. There's one in Skyrim, in the Pine Forest. Performing the
        Ritual of the Ancestor Moth within the glade should provide the
        answers you seek.

Dragonborn: Explain this "ritual."

Dexion: It involves carefully removing the bark from the Canticle Tree which
        will in turn attract Ancestor Moths to you. Once enough of the moths
        are following, they'll provide you with the second sight needed to
        decipher the scrolls.

Dragonborn: Carefully gather the bark? How?

Dexion: In keeping with tradition, you must use a specific tool in the Ancestor
        Glade, an implement known as a Draw Knife. Every Moth Priest is taught
        this ritual, but few ever get the chance to perform it...you should
        consider yourself fortunate if it works for you.

Dragonborn: Do I need to read the scrolls in any particular order?

Dexion: From what I saw in the vision, the Elder Scroll which foreshadows the
        defiance of the gods with the blood of mortals is the key to the
        prophecy.

[One can talk to Dexion about new options at this point.]

Dragonborn: How's a moth related to the Elder Scrolls?

Dexion: Well, as I am sure you've figured out by now, it's no mere coincidence
        we are named "Moth Priests." The voice of the Ancestor Moth has always
        been an integral part of reading the Elder Scrolls.

Dragonborn: Moths barely make a sound, let alone speak.

Dexion: Oh, the moths don't literally read the scrolls...but they maintain a
        connection to ancient magic that allows the Moth Priests to decipher
        them. If you listen closely when you find the glade, you should be able
        to hear their song...a soft, harmonious trilling. It's through this
        ancestral chorus that the moths tap into a form of primal augur and
        become a conduit for deciphering the scrolls.

Dragonborn: How does that help the Moth Priest?

Dexion: By having the Ancestor Moths close to the Moth Priest, they can utilize
        the conduit and share the moth's augury. Only the most resilient of
        priests can do it this way...it takes years of practice to interpret
        the harmony.

Dragonborn: Then how do I even stand a chance?

Dexion: You've come this far, and you've found several Elder Scrolls. Whether
        you believe it or not, the scrolls have a mind of their own. If they
        didn't want you to find them, they wouldn't allow it. Because of this,
        I strongly believe you were meant to hear the ancestral chorus. Only
        one way to find out.

Dragonborn: What went wrong?

Dexion: Deciphering one of the Elder Scrolls is nothing like reading a simple
        book. There is quite a bit of ritual and concentration required. It
        can take months or even years to complete a single scroll and even
        then, months to recover.

Dragonborn: Is it normal for Moth Priests to go blind?

Dexion: Sadly, yes. It is the inevitable fate we agree to pursue when reading
        the Elder Scrolls. It generally does not occur until a Moth Priest is
        in his latter years, but in my case I simply was not preparing myself
        properly.

[DW10] UNSEEN VISIONS |========================================================
______________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player and Serana visit the glade, high in Falkreath's mountains. Inside
 is a bunch of loose foliage and crags.]

Serana: This must be the place. Hmph...not very impressive, is it? If this ends
        up being a wasted trip, your friend Dexion and I are going to have some
        words when we get back.

[They head further in, finding a massive cavern, replete with a freshwater
 waterfall and spring, plus trees everywhere.]

Serana: Wow. Look at this place. No one's been here in centuries. I doubt
        there's any other place like it in Skyrim. It's beautiful.

[They find a draw knife in a ceremonial holder below.]

Serana: Well, we got the knife...now all we need to do is track down one of
        those Canticle Trees.

[There's a blossoming Canticle on a higher ledge.]

Serana: Hope those moths like that bark as much as Dexion said they would.
        Dexion didn't really give us a lot to go on, did he?

[One moves around the area, finding swarms of moths and getting them to follow
 with the others.]

Serana: Look at them...they've definitely taken a liking to you. And unless
        I'm seeing things, you're starting to...glimmer.

[Soon, a sphere of ancient light is enveloping the player.]

Serana: Woah! I think that might have been what we were waiting for. Let's
        head back up there and see if we can read the scrolls.

[They go to the spring and stand in a column of sunlight. The player begins
 reading the the Blood scroll.]

Serana: Nervous?

[The player reads the scrolls, and sees some kind of cryptic map.]

Serana: Are you okay? Almost thought I lost you there...you went as white as
        the snow.

        Don't worry, I'm fine.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I never trusted those damn scrolls. Who knows what those things could
         have done to you...just look at Dexion.

        That felt strange.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I could see it in your eyes. You looked about a thousand leagues away.

        Never mind that...it worked!
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         After everything we've been through, it had damn well better work.

        What about Auriel's Bow? Do you know where we can find it?

Dragonborn: It's in a place called Darkfall Cave.

Serana: Then it's almost over.

        • We can finally rewrite the prophecy as we see fit.
        • We can finally put an end to this ridiculous prophecy.

        Where is this "Darkfall Cave?"

Dragonborn: The scrolls gave me its exact location.

Serana: Then let's get going. I want to get there before my father has a chance
        to track us down.

[They leave, just in time to slay intruders from the faction opposite the one
 they're currently aligned with.]

[The cave is located in the NW mountains, not far from Mor Khazgur. There's
 a short tunnel overlooking a massive torrent of water. With nowhere else to
 go, the duo jumps in, being swept downstream to the shallows. Eventually,
 they come across a small campsite with corpses stewn around.]

Serana: These people were...why would anyone want to set up camp here? I wonder
        what happened to them.

[After slaying some trolls, they see a man at a deep shrine.]

Serana: What's that? I can feel some kind of power from it...

Gelebor: Come forward. You have nothing to fear here.

[They approach Gelebor at his humble campsite.]

Gelebor: I am Knight-Paladin Gelebor. Welcome to the Great Chantry of Auri-El.

Dragonborn: This cave is a temple to Auriel?

Gelebor: Auriel, Auri-El, Alkosh, Akatosh...so many different names for the
         sovereign of the snow elves.

Dragonborn: Snow elves? You're a Falmer?

Gelebor: I prefer snow elf. The name "Falmer" usually holds a negative meaning
         to most travelers. Those twisted creatures you call Falmer, I call
         the Betrayed.

Dragonborn: I imagine you know why we're here.

Gelebor: Of course. You're here for Auriel's Bow. Why else would you be here?
         I can help you get it, but first I must have your assistance.

         What type of assistance do you need?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          I need you to kill Arch-Curate Vyrthur...my brother.

         Do I have a choice?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Absolutely. You could turn around and travel back from wherever you
          started empty handed¹, or you could assist me.

         How did you know?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          For the thousands of years I've served as the Chantry's sentinel,
          there hasn't been a single visitor here for any other reason. They
          request Auriel's Bow, and I request their assistance. It's been
          repeated so many times, I can't imagine it any other way.

Dragonborn: Kill your brother, why?

Gelebor: The kinship between us is gone. I don't understand what he's become,
         but he's no longer the brother I once knew. It was the Betrayed...
         they did something to him, I just don't know why Auri-El would allow
         this to happen.

Dragonborn: What exactly did the Betrayed do?

Gelebor: They swept into the Chantry without warning and began killing everyone
         without pause.

Dragonborn: Didn't you fight back?

Gelebor: The Chantry was a place of peaceful worship. I led a small group of
         paladins, but we were no match for the Betrayed's sheer numbers. They
         slaughtered everyone and stormed the Inner Sanctum where I believe
         they corrupted Vyrthur.

Dragonborn: You don't even know if he's alive.

Gelebor: He's alive. I've seen him. But something's wrong. He never looks as
         though he's in pain or under duress. He just...stands there and
         watches, as though waiting.

Dragonborn: Have you tried getting into the Inner Sanctum?

Gelebor: Leaving the wayshrines unguarded would be violating my sacred duty as
         a Knight-Paladin of Auriel. And an assault on the Betrayed guarding
         the Inner Sanctum would only end with my death.

Dragonborn: Wayshrine?

Gelebor: Yes, let me show you.

[The strange monument nearby rises, revealing it was actually a small, shrunken
 pavilion with only a ceremonial basin inside.]

Serana: So, this is snow elf magic. Incredible.

Gelebor: This structure is known as a wayshrine. They were used for meditation
         and for transport when the Chantry was a place of enlightenment.
         Prelates of these shrines were charged with teaching the mantras of
         Auri-El to our Initiates.

Serana: What's that basin in the center signify?

Gelebor: Once the Initiate completed his mantras, he'd dip a ceremonial ewer
         in the basin of the wayshrine's center and proceed to the next
         wayshrine.

Serana: So these Initiates had to lug around a heavy pitcher of water. 
        Marvelous. How long would they have to do that?

Gelebor: Well, once the Initiate's enlightenment was complete, he'd bring the
         ewer to the Chantry's Inner Sanctum. Pouring the contents of the ewer
         into the sacred basin of the Sanctum would allow him to enter for an
         audience with the Arch-Curate himself.

Serana: All that just to end up dumping it out? Makes no sense to me.

Gelebor: It's symbolic. I don't expect you to understand.

Serana: So, let's get this straight. We need to do all that nonsense to get
        into the temple, so we can kill your brother and claim Auriel's Bow?

Gelebor: I know how it all sounds, but if there was another way I'd have done
         it long ago. The only way to get to my brother is by following in the
         Initiates' footsteps and traveling from wayshrine to wayshrine just
         as they did. The first lay at the end of Darkfall Passage, a cavern
         that represents the absence of enlightenment.

Dragonborn: How many more wayshrines are there?

Gelebor: There are five in total, spread far across the Chantry.

Dragonborn: These caves must be massive.

Gelebor: Caves? Oh, no. The Chantry encompasses far more than a few caves, as
         you'll soon discover. But before I send you on your way, you'll need
         the Initiate's Ewer.

Dragonborn: So I need to fill this at each wayshrine?

Gelebor: Once you've located a wayshrine, there will be spectral Prelate
         tending to it. They will allow you to draw the waters from the
         shrine's basin as if you've been enlightened.

Dragonborn: I'll be off then.

Gelebor: This may be the last time we're able to converse. If you have any
         questions before you leave, I suggest you ask them. Otherwise, all I
         can do now is grant you my hopes for a safe journey.

[If one inquires further to Gelebor...]

Gelebor: Questions? I expected as much.

Dragonborn: Who are the spectral Prelates you mentioned?

Gelebor: They're ghosts of the snow elf priests that tended the wayshrines
         before being slaughtered by the Betrayed. Through the grace of
         Auri-El, they were restored to their spectral form to enable them to
         continue their duties.

Dragonborn: Good, they should be able to help us.

Gelebor: I'm afraid in their current form, they still believe the Chantry to be
         an active center of worship. They won't respond to you in any way
         other than believing that you're an Initiate and you're undertaking
         the journey to the Inner Sanctum.

Dragonborn: What is the Chantry of Auri-El?

Gelebor: This is, or was, the epicenter for our religion. Most of the snow elf
         people worshipped Auri-El. The Chantry was constructed near the
         beginning of the First Era to provide a retreat to those that wished
         to become enlightened.

Dragonborn: Most snow elves?

Gelebor: Our empire had temples to some of the other deities: Trinimac,
         Syrabane, Jephre and Phynaster rounded out the rest. But those temples
         paled in comparison to the glory of the Chantry and its wayshrines.

Dragonborn: The wayshrines are part of the Chantry then?

Gelebor: Oh yes. They were an important part of the process here. They
         represented the steps the Initiates took on the path to total
         enlightenment. Sadly, the magic used to construct these wonders were
         lost long before I arrived here.

Dragonborn: Who were your people?

Gelebor: We were once a wealthy and prosperous society that occupied a portion
         of Skyrim. Unfortunately, we were constantly at war with the Nords
         who claimed the land as their ancestral home.

Dragonborn: It appears the Nords won.

Gelebor: In a manner of speaking. We had always maintained an uneasy alliance
         with the underground-dwelling dwarves, and when faced with extinction
         we turned to them for help. Surprisingly, they agreed to protect us
         but demanded a terrible price...the blinding of our race.

Dragonborn: Everyone couldn't have possibly agreed to that.

Gelebor: There were splinter groups that resisted the agreement, and even some
         that sought alternate alliances. But when it was all said and done,
         those elves were either slaughtered, vanished or gave up and took the
         dwarves' bargain.

Dragonborn: What turned your people into the Betrayed?

Gelebor: I've often asked myself the same question. The blinding of my race
         was supposedly accomplished with a toxin. Certainly not enough to
         devolve them into the sad and twisted beings they've become.

Dragonborn: Why weren't the snow elves here afflicted?

Gelebor: The Chantry is quite isolated, so it took some time for word of the
         dwarves' offer to reach us here. By the time the compact had been
         completed, it was too late for us to even attempt to intervene.

Dragonborn: Is that why you had retained your sight?

Gelebor: Correct. We only numbered perhaps a hundred at the time, so our
         presence remained a secret to the dwarves and the Nords. Ironically,
         our undoing came at the hands of our own people.

Dragonborn: You mean the Betrayed.

Gelebor: Yes. They swarmed the Chantry in vast numbers until we were completely
         overrun. We never really stood a chance. I assume that the Arch-Curate
         was corrupted by them when they found a way to breach the Inner
         Sanctum.

Dragonborn: There were others here like you?

Gelebor: Vyrthur and myself are the only two snow elves that remain.

[The snow elf magic opens a wayshrine portal to Darkfall Passage.]

Serana: Well...that wasn't as unpleasant as I thought it would be. Kind of
        soothing, actually. I feel a little warmer, now.

[They start slaying the Falmer inhabitants.]

Serana: Looks like these Falmer are here to stay. They must be who that priest
        was calling "the Betrayed."

[They come to a pull-chain door with a warrior's skeleton beside it.]

Serana: Hmmm. Pull chains and traps. Be careful here. Whatever's on the other
        side of this, the Falmer wanted to keep there.

[They find a Vale Sabre Cat beyond, one of the first new Chantry monsters. The
 duo progresses downward through the mountain passage, past crystal-ridden
 caverns filled with strange animals.]

Serana: This is the kind of thing I've been wanting to see. Makes everything
        worth it. I think that's another wayshrine up there. Here we go.

[They come upon a shrine and its ghostly prelate.]

Sidanyis: Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Illumination. Are you
          prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with
          His enlightenment?

Dragonborn: Yes.

Sidanyis: Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it light your path as you
          seek tranquility within the Inner Sanctum. May Auri-El's brilliance
          illuminate your path.

[They fill the ewer and reach the Forgotten Vale. Unlike the rest of Skyrim,
 this mountain-tucked landscape has the remnants of snow elf architecture.]

Serana: This is incredible. It's like a whole other world. Come on, the bow
        has to be in this valley somewhere. Is that another one of those
        wayshrines up there? I wonder where this one goes...

[They reach the nearby shrine.]

Athring: Welcome, Initiate. This is the Wayshrine of Sight. Are you prepared
         to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His
         enlightenment?

Dragonborn: Yes.

Athring: Then behold Auri-El's gift, my child. May it speed your journey to the
         Inner Sanctum. May Auri-El's light guide you in your darkest hours.

[They continue on.]

Serana: Is that another one of those wayshrines up there? I wonder where this
        one goes...

[They reach the next shrine.]

Celegriath: You've reached the Wayshrine of Learning, Initiate. Are you
            prepared to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with
            His enlightenment?

Dragonborn: Yes.

Celegriath: Auri-El bless you, child. For you are a step closer to the Inner
            Sanctum and everlasting wisdom. May Auri-El's warmth imbue your
            body with strength.

[From the riverbank, they spot the next 'shrine on a far-off cliff.]

Serana: If we open that one, we'll be able to move around this valley a lot
        faster.

[They reach it.]

Nirilor: You've arrived at the Wayshrine of Resolution. Are you prepared to
         honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His
         enlightenment?

Dragonborn: Yes.

Nirilor: Then go forth, child. May the enrichment of Auri-El strengthen your
         resolve as you undertake your journey to the Inner Sanctum. May
         Auri-El's glow shield you from your enemy.

[To reach the final shrine, Serana and her helper must travel the Falmer-choked
 mountain canyon. In the ensuing cave, they come across more Betrayed fighting
 a troll, and must put them down one and all.]

Serana: Poor thing. I know it would have tried to kill us, but still...

[There's a rickety bridge nearby.]

Serana: Not the most solid construction. About what I'd expect from...creatures
        like this. Looks like they're better at making traps than they are at
        making bridges. A strange race, these Falmer.

[Through a glacial crevice, the final wayshrine is finally in sight.]

Edhelbor: You've found the Wayshrine of Radiance, Initiate. Are you prepared
          to honor the mantras of Auri-El and fill your vessel with His
          enlightenment?

Dragonborn: Yes.

Edhelbor: May the blessings of Auri-El protect you as you climb the road to
          the Inner Sanctum and final enlightenment. May Auri-El's radiance
          fill your heart with joy.

[The Inner Sanctum, a marvel of snow elf design, is right nearby.]

Serana: That...that has to be the place. I've never seen a building like that
        before. It looks like some kind of temple. Never saw anything like this
        back on the island.

[They enter the courtyard.]

Serana: That is a statue of Auriel, but it's using the older signs of his
        power. This temple must be ancient. The bow has to be in here.

[As the water is placed in the final basin, it opens the destination's door.
 Inside, the long-frozen corpses of snow elves can be seen.]

Serana: These Falmer are...they're frozen in the ice. I wonder how long they've
        been like this. And I thought the Soul Cairn was creepy.

[They reach the chapel, cut right into the glacier. The Arch-Curate's there.]

Vyrthur: Did you really come here expecting to claim Auriel's Bow? You've done
         exactly as I predicted and brought your fetching companion to me.

Serana: Wait, is he talking about me?

Vyrthur: Which, I'm sorry to say, means your usefulness is at an end!

[They destroy the frozen Falmer he unleashes.]

Vyrthur: An impressive display, but a wasted effort. You delay nothing but your
         own deaths!

Serana: Watch out! He's pulling down the ceiling!

Vyrthur: Finish them!

[More of his icy acolytes are smashed.]

Vyrthur: This has gone on long enough. Child, my life ended long before you
         were born!

[They kill all his companions.]

Vyrthur: No...I won't let you ruin centuries of preparations...

Serana: Surrender and give us the bow!

Vyrthur: Death first!

[The snow elf magic destroys the Sanctum's walls and ceiling.]

Serana: Are you alright? Come on, we can do this. I know we can. He's up there,
        on the balcony. Come on!

[They corner him.]

Serana: Enough, Vyrthur. Give us the bow!

Vyrthur: How dare you. I was the Arch-Curate of Auri-El, girl. I had the ears
         of a god!

Serana: Until the "Betrayed" corrupted you. Yes, yes. We've heard this sad
        story.

Vyrthur: Gelebor and his kind are easily manipulated fools. Look into my eyes,
         Serana. You tell me what I am.

Serana: You're...you're a vampire? But Auriel should have protected you...

Vyrthur: The moment I was infected by one of my own Initiates, Auri-El turned
         his back on me. I swore I'd have my revenge, no matter what the cost.

Serana: You want to take revenge...on a god?

Vyrthur: Auri-El himself may have been beyond my reach, but his influence on
         our world wasn't. All I needed was the blood of a vampire and his own
         weapon, Auriel's Bow.

Serana: The blood of a vampire...Auriel's Bow... It...it was you? You created
        that prophecy?

Vyrthur: A prophecy that lacked a single, final ingredient...the blood of a
         pure vampire. The blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour.

Serana: You were waiting...all this time for someone with my blood to come
        along. Well, too bad for you...I intend on keeping it. Let's see if
        your blood has any power to it!

Vyrthur: What trickery is this!

[They kill him.]

Vyrthur: Farewell.

[His death activates the final wayshrine. Gelebor steps out.]

Gelebor: So, the deed has been done. The restoration of this wayshrine means
         that Vyrthur must be dead and the Betrayed no longer have control
         over him.

Dragonborn: The Betrayed weren't to blame.

Gelebor: What? What are you talking about?

Dragonborn: He was a vampire. He controlled them.

Gelebor: A vampire? I see. That would explain much. Deep inside, it brings me
         joy that the Betrayed weren't to blame for what happened here.

Dragonborn: Why?

Gelebor: Because that means there's still hope that they might one day shed
         their hatred and learn to believe in Auri-El once again. It's been
         a long time since I felt that way and it's been long overdue. My
         thanks, to both of you.

Dragonborn: You're welcome.

Gelebor: You risked everything to get Auri-El's Bow, and in return, you've
         restored the Chantry. I can't think of a more deserving champion to
         carry it than you. If you wish to learn more about the bow, or obtain
         Sunhallowed Arrows for it, I'd be more than happy to help. You've but
         to ask.

[One can inquire further.]

Gelebor: Please, take the bow...it's yours.

Dragonborn: What will happen to you now?

Gelebor: Even with Vyrthur gone and the Inner Sanctum destroyed, my duty as a
         Knight-Paladin of Auri-El remains. I've been sworn to protect this
         vale and everything it represents until I die.

Dragonborn: And the wayshrines?

Gelebor: For the time being, they will remain open. If remnants of our kind
         who escaped the betrayal at the hands of the dwarves exist out there,
         perhaps they will find this place one day.

Dragonborn: What can you tell me about Auriel's Bow?

Gelebor: The bow was said to be carried by Auri-El himself into battle against
         the forces of Lorkhan in ancient and mythic times. Its craftsmanship
         has no equal anywhere within Tamriel and possibly beyond.

Dragonborn: What can it do?

Gelebor: The bow draws its power from Aetherius itself, channeling it through
         the sun. Therefore, when an arrow is loosed from the bow, it produces
         a magical effect very similar to being burned by fire.

Dragonborn: Sounds powerful.

Gelebor: That's actually only a fraction of its potential. With Sunhallowed
         Arrows, you would be able to produce a much more spectacular effect...
         causing bursts of sunlight to envelop your foes. The sunbursts would
         certainly hurt anything, but is especially devastating to the undead.

Dragonborn: Vyrthur said something about using blood?

Gelebor: Well, using an arrow with the bow that's been dipped in blood may
         cause it to function differently...corrupting its purpose. That's of
         course if you're foolish enough to try it.

Dragonborn: How do I obtain Sunhallowed Arrows?

Gelebor: I can actually assist you in that regard. If you were to bring me some
         good quality elven arrows, I could imbue them with the proper
         incantations and rituals.

Dragonborn: Can you make me some Sunhallowed Arrows?

            • Absolutely. I can only do twenty at a time, so if you want the
              rest of your arrows blessed, let me know.
            • Absolutely. I can only do twenty at a time, but I see that won't
              be a problem in this case.
            • I'm afraid I'll need elven arrows if you want me to produce
              Sunhallowed Arrows, and it seems you're all out of them at the
              moment.

Dragonborn: Can the Betrayed ever be cured?

Gelebor: I feel nothing but sympathy for the Betrayed, despite my actions
         against them. But I'm afraid that they're well beyond a cure at this
         point.

Dragonborn: Why?

Gelebor: The twisted forms you've seen didn't occur overnight. It isn't a
         plague or a disease that ravaged our species. The dwarves may have
         stolen their sight, but it took many generations for them to become
         what they are today.

Dragonborn: Then there's no hope for them.

Gelebor: Perhaps they'll never return to their former appearance, but over the
         centuries, I've noticed a rise in their intellect. If a line of
         communication could be established with them, maybe they can find
         peace. It's the only way they'll discover that they weren't always
         malignant...they were once a proud and prosperous race.

Dragonborn: What will happen to the Chantry now?

Gelebor: While it would fill me with joy to see the Chantry back to its former
         glory, that time has long since passed. Now that my brother's dead,
         it's quite possibly I'm the last of our kind.

Dragonborn: Then I've contributed to your kind's extinction.

Gelebor: There's no need for that kind of talk. I said it was possible. It's
         also quite possible that there are some other isolated conclaves of
         snow elves nestled elsewhere on Nirn. I'll also assume Vyrthur didn't
         exactly give you the option to stay your hand.

Dragonborn: What will you do then?

Gelebor: For the time being I will remain here, on the overlook and continue
         trying to keep the Sanctum free of the Betrayed. You're always welcome
         to return here at any time, of course.

[DW12] KINDRED JUDGMENT |======================================================
________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[The player claims the hallowed bow from the shrine.]

Serana: It's...not as shiny as I was expecting. Still, it's beautiful.

Dragonborn: What do we do now?

Serana: • Well, before we spoke to my mother in the Soul Cairn, I would have
          said we bring the bow to my father. But after everything with her...I
          don't think we can trust him.

        • I think we both know...it's time to face my father. If we don't,
          he'll keep chasing us for the rest of our lives.

        Then we kill him, before he kills us.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I keep thinking that there's got to be another way, but he'll turn on
         us the moment he gets the chance.

        If we do, he'll have to die.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I've been thinking about this for a long time. It's...it's not easy.
         But I don't think we have much of a choice.

        We have the bow, he'll listen to us.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Have you been paying attention to everything that's happened? He'll
         betray us the second our backs are turned.

        Maybe we can reason with him.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Have you been paying attention? It's obvious my father's well beyond
         reason.

        We should honor our agreement with him.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Are you out of your mind? The moment you hand over the bow your
         usefulness ends. He'll kill you and then he'll take my blood for the
         damn prophecy.

        Let's run as far from him as we can.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         There's nowhere to run. And I'm certainly not moving in with my
         mother, if that's what you're implying.

        • No. He has to die. We have no choice.
        • No. This has to end here and now.

Dragonborn: Then let's face him, together.

Serana: • Thank you. Somehow I knew you'd understand.
        • If we head back to the castle and kick the front door in, we're going
          to be knee-deep in his friends. Let's head back to Isran and let him
          see what we've got first. I'm betting he'll lend us a sword or two.

[One can ask about Vyrthur's plan...]

Dragonborn: Vyrthur was saying something about vampire blood and the bow...

Serana: It sounds like...that's the last bit of the prophecy. The blood of a
        Daughter of Coldharbour can corrupt the bow.

        Can I use your blood, then?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Sure...do you have any arrows, though? They would have to be of elven
         quality, I'd guess.

        You're a Daughter of Coldharbour.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         So I am. I guess we could use my blood. Do you have any arrows? Elven
         arrows. I'm not going to just bleed on any old thing.

         I'd like to treat some arrows with your blood.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          • Let's just get this over with.
          • I think you'll need to find some arrows, first. Only elven ones
            will work for this, remember?

         I'm not going to take your blood right now.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Oh. All right, then.

Dragonborn: Are you ready to do this?

Serana: I don't think you can ever be ready to kill your parent. I'm doing my
        best to not think of him as my father anymore.

        That's a good way to be thinking.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I hope so.

        Let me know if you need anything.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         We've got enough to worry about right now. You stay focused, and I'll
         worry about me.

        • Just...leave me alone for now. I'll be fine.

#################### ON THE DAWNGUARD SIDE ####################

[One returns to Isran after exploring the Vale.]

Isran: The bow...you have Auriel's Bow! I've heard it described in tales, but
       I could never have imagined its beauty.

Dragonborn: We need your help, Isran.

Isran: Indeed. The day hasn't been won while Harkon still walks Tamriel. But
       what of Serana? Can she be trusted to lift a blade against her own kind?
       Her own family?

Dragonborn: I trust her to do the right thing.

Isran: I suppose that's as much as I can hope for. Let me address the
       Dawnguard, and then we'll be off. The men deserve to know we've finally
       gained the upper hand. Everyone! Gather 'round! Come on then, we haven't
       got all day!

       For too long we've allowed these vampires to poison the night and kill
       our people! Now, we finally have the means to strike back! We now have
       Auriel's Bow. The gods themselves have favored us and we must answer
       with action. The time has come to finally put an end to Harkon and his
       unholy prophecy! We will march on their land and destroy those wretched
       abominations so they can no longer corrupt our world! This is our fight
       and this is our fate! This is the time of the Dawnguard!

Celann: Kill the abominations!

Isran: This is it!

Gunmar: Send them to Oblivion!

Sorine: Give him a crossbow bolt right between the eyes for me!

Durak: The prophecy is no more!

Isran: It's time we take the fight to their door. Gather your things and rest
       well, my friend. We meet outside Castle Volkihar.

[The Dawnguard assembles outside the vampires' castle. The hunters slay Modhna,
 Rargal, Namasur and Stalf, plus their beloved cohorts on the bridge. The
 fight moves into the dining hall, where the rest of the lesser vampires are
 put to the sword. Finally, it's time to visit the chapel.]

#################### ON THE VAMPIRES' SIDE ####################

[Everyone returns to Volkihar to confront Harkon. Before finding him, some of
 the other vampires will comment on it. This is optional, but eh well.]

Garan: Auriel's Bow. Well done, indeed.
Garan: Find Lord Harkon. Let him know the time of the prophecy is at hand.

Ronthil: I knew you would be victorious.
Ronthil: Our lord will be most pleased, I'm sure. I knew you could do it.

Orthjolf: All of Skyrim will tremble before us.
Orthjolf: Don't keep our master waiting. Take him the bow immediately.

Feran: You have the bow...
Feran: I'm sure your reward will be great for ensuring our Lord's success.

Rargal: Who'll need thralls when the very sun is at our mercy?
Rargal: Go find Lord Harkon. Tell him of your success.

Vingalmo: Auriel's power is ours!
Vingalmo: I'm sure Lord Harkon will be most pleased with your efforts. Find
          him at once.

Fura: Present the bow to Lord Harkon at once!

Hestla: You've served us all well, friend.
Hestla: Auriel's Bow is ours. Deliver it to Lord Harkon at once, so we can reap
        the benefits of this prophecy.

#################### ON BOTH PATHS ####################

[The player and Serana find Harkon in the cathedral, where Molag Bal's blood
 shrine is. The Lord is waiting in his Vampire Lord form.]

Harkon: • So, you've returned. Is your...pet keeping you entertained?
        • Serana, my darling. I see you still favor keeping a pet.

Serana: You know why we're here.

Harkon: Of course I do. You disappoint me, Serana. You've taken everything I've
        provided for you and thrown it all away for this

        • ...pathetic half-breed vampire.
        • ...pathetic being.

Serana: Provided for me? Are you insane? You've destroyed our family. You've
        killed other vampires. All over some prophecy that we barely
        understand. No more. I'm done with you. You will not touch him.

[Harkon sees she's drawn her weapon.]

Harkon: So, I see this dragon has fangs. Your voice drips with the venom of
        your mother's influence. How alike you've become.

Serana: No... Because unlike her, I'm not afraid of you. Not anymore.

Harkon: And you... It appears I have you to thank for turning my daughter
        against me. I knew it was only a matter of time before

        • your ambition outgrew your loyalty.
        • she'd return with hatred in her heart.

Dragonborn: • Loyalty? You never intended to let me live.
            • Hatred born of your neglect.

Harkon: A small price to pay for the betterment of our kind.

Dragonborn: • You're an insult to our kind.
            • Your kind is a blight on this world.

Harkon: • Oh, come now...spare me your notions of kinship. You've simply used
        Serana in an attempt to take away what should rightfully be mine.

        • Yes, yes. Always the noble vampire hunter. And what happens when
          you've slain me? Is Valerica next? Is Serana?

        I would never use Serana like that.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         The vampire is eternal, and with immortality comes the revelation that
         these bonds never endure... It's fleeting, momentary at best.

        I would never harm Serana. She's too important to me.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Then my daughter is truly lost. She died the moment she accepted a
         mortal into her life.

        No, I'm here to prevent our annihilation.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ah, I see you've been speaking to Valerica and she's convinced you
         that eternal night will plunge us into war with daytime dwellers. If
         only it were so. With the world in shadow, we would never tire, never
         weaken...more than a match for their pitiful armies.

        I'm only here to kill you.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I see. Interesting that you can set aside your morals when it suits
         you.

        This is about more than killing vampires.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Ah, of course. The prophecy. You've come here to stop me from taking
         Auriel's Bow and shrouding the world in darkness.

        The bow belongs to me now.²
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Finally, a trace of honesty in our little conversation. How does it
         feel to hold the fate of the vampire in your grasp? Exhilarating,
         isn't it?

        Enough of this!
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes, quite. I'm growing weary of speaking to you and my traitorous
         daughter. I'll give you a single chance to turn over the bow to me.
         There will not be a second.

         Never.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Very well then, you leave me no choice!

         Very well. (Give Auriel's Bow)
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Pitiful. Simply pitiful. I expected more from the defiant fool that
          beguiled my daughter. No matter. Serana will sacrifice her blood for
          the sake of the prophecy, and I will feast upon yours in Molag Bal's
          honor!

        ...²
        ¯¯¯¯
         Little patience for talk? Good. Let's end this!

        • Auriel's Bow will be mine!
        • I will darken the skies!

[Serana will give various lines during the ensuing fight.]

Serana: Tough day for you!
Serana: The bow! Use the bow!
Serana: You can't hide from us!
Serana: Sorry it had to be this way!
Serana: This day was always coming!
Serana: I still remember how to fight!

[They fight Harkon. When he retreats to the blood fountain to restore life,
 Auriel's Bow dispels his barrier like it's papier-mâché. Eventually, the
 coup de grace is dealt. Harkon collapses and melts by the altar.]

Harkon: No...Serana...your own father...

Serana: Well, now that's done.

Dragonborn: What will you do now?

Serana: I'm not sure.

        • I'll probably stay here, for as long as they'll let me. I think we
          can rebuild here. Make my family's legacy something more respectable.

        • I'll probably stay with the Dawnguard, for as long as they let me.
          They're respectable fighters, and I think they see the benefits of
          having a vampire on their side, now.

        Of course, if you've got any more adventures planned...

        I'd love to have you along.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         That's what I wanted to hear.

        I don't think they'll involve you.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Suit yourself.

#################### ON VAMPIRE PATH ONLY ####################

[Garan Marethi enters and sees the carnage and Harkon's bloody remains.]

Garan: Lord Harkon, defeated. I never imagined I'd see the day. My lady, you
       have my deepest sympathies. I am sure this was not easy for you.

Serana: He was out of control, Garan. It had to be done. I'm not happy about
        this. He...he was still my father. But I suppose my father really died
        a long time ago. This was just the end of something else.

Garan: Of course, my dear. All will be well now.

[The questline has ended by this point, though some vampires will comment on
 the startling outcome.]

Garan: My congratulations on defeating Harkon. Clearly, you are the superior
       vampire.

Fura Bloodmouth: None can deny your power now.

Hestla: No one will soon forget that you were the one to defeat Harkon.

Rargal: My lord.

Vingalmo: I am at your service, as always.

[Garan has extra dialogue.]

Dragonborn: Something on your mind, Garan?

Garan: Well, now that the Castle is yours, I was wondering. Would you be
       interested in having the passage to the Courtyard restored? Harkon
       clearly never cared much for it.

       See to it at once.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        It would be my pleasure.

       I don't care. Do as you like.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Then I think I shall see to the repairs. Thank you for your time.

       Stop wasting my time, Garan.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        My apologies. I shall not trouble you with it again.

#################### ON DAWNGUARD PATH ONLY ####################

[After Harkon's demise, Isran walks into the cathedral.]

Isran: It's over. He's dead, and the prophecy dies with him. I...I suppose this
       is difficult for you.

Serana: I think my father really died a long time ago. This was just...the end
        of something else. I did what needed to be done. Nothing more.

Isran: I think perhaps...I think you did more than that. You have my thanks.

[He turns to the player.]

Isran: So, the beast is destroyed. Not only that, but Auriel's Bow is in safe
       hands. The Dawnguard will now be dedicated to safeguarding it, making
       sure that prophecy will never come to pass. You've served Skyrim well.
       Even with these vampires gone, the fight isn't completely over. Once
       we're settled back in at the fort, there will be more work to do. We'd
       be honored to have you join us.

#################### ON EITHER SIDE ####################

[If one revisits Valerica in the Soul Cairn, the good news can be conveyed.]

Dragonborn: Harkon is dead.

Valerica: What? Are you certain?

Dragonborn: He died by my hand.

Valerica: Then I see nothing preventing my return to Tamriel. Allow me to
          gather some of my things and I'll head back to Castle Volkihar. And
          from the bottom of my heart, I thank you.

[After exiting the Cairn:]

Dragonborn: What will you do now?

Valerica: Well, I think it's time I got back to my work as an alchemist. The
          Soul Cairn will offer a unique opportunity to continue my studies,
          and I intend to complete my research. In the meantime, if there are
          any potions you might need, feel free to help yourself.

Dragonborn: Can you give me Bloodcursed Arrows?

Valerica: I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable giving them to you. I understand
          what you did for

          • my family,
          • Serana and for me,

          but the prophecy never sat well with me, and I don't want to be part
          of it. I'm sorry.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[When entering a city, the player is randomly accosted by masked weirdos.]

Cultist: You there! You're the one they call Dragonborn?

         Yes, I am Dragonborn.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Your lies fall on deaf ears, Deceiver. The True Dragonborn comes...
          You are but his shadow.

         The Greybeards seem to think so...
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Then it is too late. The lie has already taken root in the hearts of
          men. So we shall expose to them the falseness in their hearts by
          tearing out yours, Deceiver!

         I don't know what you're talking about.
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Your lies fall on deaf ears, Deceiver! We know you are the False
          Dragonborn! You shall not stand in the way of the true Dragonborn's
          return. He comes soon, and we shall offer him your heart!

         When Lord Miraak appears all shall bear witness. None shall stand to
         oppose him!

[After killing the belligerent freaks, one finds a note on their person that
 mentions they originated in Solstheim, using Windhelm's Northern Maiden to
 reach Skyrim. The player travels to that city's docks in search, finding
 Captain Gjalund Salt-Sage on his ship.]

Gjalund: If you're looking for passage to Solstheim, too bad. I'm not going
         back there anymore.

         Are you the captain of the Northern Maiden?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Sure. Yeah. That's me. Why? Who sent you?

          I was attacked by some cultists who came here on your ship.²
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Now hold on! That wasn't my fault...I didn't know they were going
           to attack anybody. I don't even know how I got here.

           How can you not know how you got here? You sailed here, right?
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            (same as "What happened? Why...")

         What happened? Why won't you go back?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          It's hard to explain. I remember those people with the masks coming
          on board, then... Next thing I remember, I was here and they were
          gone. That's not right, losing whole days like that. There's been
          something strange going on there for a while, but after this...I'm
          done. I'm not going back to Solstheim.

          Yes, you are. You're taking me to Solstheim.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Have you been listening to me? I'm not going back there.

           I'll pay you double your usual rate. (Give 500 gold)
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            • Well...a man's got to make a living, after all. Fine. We'll cast
              off immediately.

            • That's a tempting offer...when you actually have the gold, I
              might be willing to consider it.

           You owe me. Those cultists you brought here tried to kill me.
           (Persuade)² |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            • Alright, you have a point. Taking you back to find them is the
              least I can do. Besides, maybe you can put a stop to whatever's
              going on over there. I owe them a bit of payback myself.

            • Look, I'm sorry about your troubles, but I've got to look out
              for myself. I'm not going to risk it.

           People are trying to kill me. I'm not taking no for an answer.
           (Intimidate)² |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            • Hold on, now. I'm just a simple sailor. I never wanted to get
              mixed up in any of this. Alright, I'll take you. But we leave
              immediately.

            • Yeah, well, and I don't want them trying to kill me. So the
              answer is still no.

           I'll be back.
           ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
            Whatever you want. The answer isn't going to be any different later
            though.

         Solstheim? Where's that?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Surprised you've never heard of it. It's an island northeast of here.
          Has a small dark elf town called Raven Rock and a handful of Nords
          living in Skaal Village. But I'm not going back there. There's
          something wrong with about that place.

[The player books passage and, after a few days, arrives at Raven Rock, the
 island's main port of call.]

Gjalund: Well, here we are. This is Raven Rock. Can't say I'm all that glad to
         see it again. Good luck. Maybe you can figure out what's going on
         around here.

[A man, Adril Arano, approaches on the docks.]

Adril: I don't recognize you, so I'll assume this is your first visit to Raven
       Rock, outlander. State your intentions.

       I'm looking for Miraak. Do you know him?²
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Miraak...I...I'm not sure that I do.

       Just looking for work.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        You've picked one of the worst places in Morrowind to do that, but suit
        yourself.

       None of your business.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That's the kind of attitude that's going to land you in prison, but
        I'll let it go for now.

       Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This
       is Morrowind, not Skyrim. While you're here you will be expected to
       abide by our laws. Any questions?

       You know who Miraak is?²
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I...I'm unsure. I swear I know the name, but cannot place it.

        Can you tell me anything about him?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I don't think so. I'm not... The name has something to do with the
         Earth Stone, I think. But I'm not sure what.

       Why are you so suspicious of visitors?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I have to be. As Second Councilor, the security of Raven Rock is my
        primary concern.

        Has security been an issue?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         This isn't exactly the city of Blacklight. We're on the frontier here,
         and we've had more than a fair share of troubles. After all we've been
         through together, I refuse to let Councilor Morvayn down.

         What do your titles mean?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Councilor Morvayn is House Redoran's representative on Solstheim. As
          second councilor, it's my job to support him and make certain his
          rule is enforced.

         What is the city of Blacklight?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          Your ignorance of our homeland doesn't surprise me. It's the capital
          of Morrowind...been that way ever since Mournhold was sacked by the
          Argonians. I don't visit there often anymore, but we still get the
          occasional supply ship and visitors from there.

          The Argonians invaded Morrowind?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Quite a while ago, yes. They cut a bloody swath across most of the
           southern region of Morrowind. Nobody seems certain why it
           happened...an attempt at expansion, revenge for the enslavement of
           their people or perhaps both. Whatever the case may be, thousands
           of Dunmer needlessly lost their lives and many more were exiled from
           their homeland.

       Raven Rock is purely a Dunmer settlement?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Raven Rock started out as an Imperial settlement, but the Empire chose
        to abandon it just as my people were first setting foot here. They
        left the town in shambles...but when House Redoran took over, we turned
        it around and it became ours. And even if it's been a struggle to make
        this island livable, we're proud to call it home.

       Remember, we're watching you.

[One visits the Earth Shrine nearby -- it's a large stone that people've been
 building a structure around. The builders seem to be in some sort of trance,
 which would fit with the captain's talk of lost time. A wizard approaches.]

Neloth: You there... You don't seem to be in quite the same state as the others
        here. Very interesting. May I ask what it is you're doing here?

Dragonborn: I'm looking for someone named Miraak.

Neloth: Miraak...Miraak... It sounds familiar, and yet I can't quite place...
        Oh. Wait, I recall. But that makes very little sense. Miraak's been
        dead for thousands of years.

Dragonborn: What does that mean?

Neloth: I'm not sure, but it is fascinating, isn't it? Perhaps it has some
        relation to what's going on here. Quite unexpected. I'm afraid I can't
        give you any answers. But there are ruins of an ancient temple of
        Miraak's toward the center of the island. If I were you, I'd look
        there.

        What are these people doing?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Building something, clearly. And yet they don't seem to have much to
         say about it. I'm very interested to find out what happens when they
         finish.

        Have you tried to stop this?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Certainly not! Doing so would interfere with whatever is going on, and
         I would be unable to see how this all turns out.

        What can you tell me about Morrowind?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         • When the city of Vivec was destroyed, it took decades for us to
           rebuild. We are still but a shadow of our glorious past, but some
           day we will rise again.

         • You are too young to remember the Nerevarine. He defeated Dagoth Ur
           and saved us all from the blight.

         • The ignorant think it is only a place of ash and lava. It had
           rolling green plains and swamps and verdant hills too.

         • It is the only place where silt striders can be found. Although I
           managed to transplant a few here when I arrived.

         • There is the big island of Vvardenfell, and the coastal mainland.
           House Telvanni has its properties on Vvardenfell. I've never been to
           the mainland myself.

         • It's the home of the dunmer. The lesser races call us dark elves. We
           built great works there, like Vivec and Ald'ruhn. Many of them are
           destroyed now, either by Red Mountain or the argonian invasion.

         • Red Mountain dominates the island. Every now and then ash and debris
           from an eruption land on our shores.

[With the tip received, one visits the island's central temple. Like the stone
 near Raven Rock, many disparate people are, trance-like, repairing the old
 temple.]

[DR02] THE TEMPLE OF MIRAAK |==================================================
____________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[In the middle of the arena-like courtyard, the player finds Frea, a Nord. She
 isn't laboring like the others.]

Frea: You there. What brings you to this place? Why are you here?

Dragonborn: Who are you?

Frea: I am Frea of the Skaal. I am here to either save my people, or avenge
      them.

Dragonborn: Save them from what?

Frea: I am unsure. Something has taken control of most of the people of
      Solstheim. It makes them forget themselves, and work on these horrible
      creations that corrupt the Stones, the very land itself. My father Storn,
      our shaman, says Miraak has returned to Solstheim, but that is
      impossible.

Dragonborn: This Miraak tried to have me killed.

Frea: Then you and I both have reason to see what lies beneath us. Let us go.
      There is nothing more I can do here. The Tree Stone and my friends are
      beyond my help for now. We need to find a way into the temple below.

      What do you know about Miraak?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       His story is as old as Solstheim itself. He served the dragons before
       their fall from power, as most did. A priest in their order. But unlike
       most, he turned against them. He made his own path, and his actions cost
       him dearly. The stories say he sought to claim Solstheim for himself,
       and the dragons destroyed him for it.

      What is the Tree Stone?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       It is an ancient stone of power, a connection to the All-Maker. It
       represents one of the aspects of nature, a part of the All-Maker's
       creation. There are other stones around Solstheim. I fear for what has
       happened to them...

      Tell me of your people, the Skaal.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       We have lived on Solstheim for many generations. Our people are tied to
       the land itself. We try to serve the All-Maker, to live in balance with
       nature, instead of exploiting it as others would.

      You're here by yourself?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       There are few of us left unaffected by this curse. My father Storn, the
       shaman, protects them in the village. I fashioned an amulet to guard me
       against whatever has taken hold of the Skaal, but it is the only one of
       its kind. If I cannot find a way to save them, there is no hope for our
       people.

[Together, they enter the lower temple.]

Frea: Are you ready to help me now? We should not delay. We should check these
      rooms for supplies before heading further into the temple. We must be
      careful in these ruins. Traps can be anywhere, and there will likely be
      many. Miraak was trying to take power here, and protect himself in the
      process.

[They enter an ancient chamber with skeletons in hanging cages.]

Frea: I do not wish to imagine what kinds of things happened in this chamber.
      Who were the poor souls trapped in these cages? What tortures did they
      suffer at Miraak's hands? Was it in service to the dragons, or for his
      own purposes? Look up there. I think I see something. The stairs are
      knocked out. I have no doubt you can find your way up. You never know,
      you may find something of value up there. I shall look around. We can
      proceed when you are ready.

[If one uses a support beam to reach the isolated ledge:]

Frea: Impressive! Was it worth the effort?

[The two head deeper into the crypt, setting of a guillotine trap.]

Frea: I am not going down there. It would be foolish to attempt it. You have a
      much better chance to make it through these traps. I have no doubt that
      lever turns the blades off. I shall wait here for now.

[One shuts off the dangerous impediment.]

Frea: Thank you. Miraak took great pains to make it difficult to reach him, it
      seems. Let us hope that is the last of these traps.

[The continue toward the sanctum.]

Frea: The evil of this place must be rooted out. I do not know what it is
      Miraak learned that gave him reason to turn on his masters. But his path
      seems to have been a cruel one. I wonder if we will find some answers to
      what happened so long ago.

[After awhile...]

Frea: How much deeper can this be? I had been told that Miraak's power was
      great, but to have built so large a temple... It cannot be much further
      now. I feel it in my bones.

[After encountering a Word Wall, the chamber shakes.]

Frea: Something feels wrong. Brace yourself!

[They kill the escaping draugr and find a key, leading into a hidden section
 of the temple.]

Frea: Dead end? Impossible. There must be something more! Look around. I will
      let you know if I find anything in the dining area.

[The player uses a weird lever.]

Frea: I knew it! A secret passage in the dining area just opened up. This must
      be it. Let us move quickly. 

[The room they find has gated stairways and grotesque statues.]

Frea: I wonder if there is something here that tells the story of Miraak...
      Nothing but ruined books. I do not recognize this statuary. We passed by
      a few of them earlier, but they are becoming more frequent as we get
      further in. I do not like this place. It almost looks as if these statues
      will come to life at any moment. It looks like there is only one way to
      proceed. I leave the honor of pulling that handle to you. I do not want
      to put my hand anywhere near the mouth of that statue.

[They continue downward.]

Frea: It is eerily quiet. I do not suspect that will be the case the further we
      go. Be on your guard.

[Deep in the heart of the temple is a massive statue-adorned stairway. The
 team slays the draugr guardians. Beyond is an ornate chamber housing only a
 large book.]

Frea: There are dark magics at work here. Ready yourself. This book... It seems
      wrong, somehow. Here, yet...not. It may be what we seek.

[As one begins to read the Black Book, a mass of tentacles drags one into a
 dark, weird realm. Inside, a man in cultist garb is conversing with two weird 
 floating creatures. A subservient dragon seems to be nearby.]

Miraak: The time comes soon when... What?

[He zaps the player, preventing them from attacking.]

Miraak: Who are you to dare set foot here? Ah... You are Dragonborn. I can feel
        it. And yet... You have done little beyond killing a few dragons. You
        have no idea of the true power a Dragonborn can wield! Mul...Qah Diiv!
        This realm is beyond you. You have no power here. And it is only a
        matter of time before Solstheim is also mine. I already control the
        minds of its people. Soon they will finish building my temple, and I
        can return home. She can await my arrival with the rest of Tamriel.

[The creatures delay the player, letting Miraak fly away on the dragon. One
 is the forcefully ejected from the book.]

Frea: What happened to you? You read the book and then... It seemed as though
      you were not really here. I could see you, but also see through you!

Dragonborn: I'm not really sure. I saw Miraak on a dragon.

Frea: Where? Where is he? Can we reach him? Can we kill him?

Dragonborn: Somehow, reading this book took me to where he was.

Frea: This is a dangerous thing, then. We should return to my village, and show
      this to my father. Perhaps Storn can make sense of what is going on.
      Come, there looks to be a way out through here.

[DR03] THE FATE OF THE SKAAL |=================================================
_____________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[Everyone escapes out into the fresh air. The Wind Stone's glow is nearby.]

Frea: You see that green light? That comes from the Wind Stone, where my
      people work against their will. They must be freed soon. My village is
      just ahead. Storn has used his magic to raise a barrier around it,
      protecting the few of us left. That the barrier is still there is a good
      sign.

[They reach the small village. In its center, a few people are meditating, and
 their energies are creating an overhead wind barrier.]

Frea: Father! I have returned! There is yet hope!

Storn: Frea! What news do you bring? Is there a way to free our people?

Frea: No, but I have brought someone who has seen things... He has confirmed
      that Miraak is the one behind the suffering of our people.

Storn: I feared that it would be so.

Frea: But how is that possible? After all this time...

Storn: I fear there is much we do not yet know.

Frea: Please, tell Storn what has happened.

Storn: So, you have seen things, yes? My magic grows weak, and so does the
       barrier around our village. Time is short. Tell me what you know.

       I've seen Miraak.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Really? How?

       Miraak is behind what's happening to your people.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        How do you know this?

Dragonborn: I read a book in Miraak's temple, and went somewhere. Miraak was
            there.

Storn: The legends speak of that place. Terrible battles fought at the temple.
       The dragons burning it to the ground in rage. They speak also of
       something worse than dragons buried within. Difficult to imagine, but
       if true... It means what I feared has come to pass. Miraak was never
       truly gone, and now has returned. If you could go to this place and see
       him... Are you like Miraak? Are you Dragonborn?

       I am indeed Dragonborn.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Then perhaps you are connected with him. The old tales say that he,
        too, was Dragonborn.

       Miraak did claim to be Dragonborn.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That is what the stories say. You are Dragonborn as well, then. Perhaps
        you are connected.

Dragonborn: What does it mean if we're both Dragonborn?

Storn: I am unsure. It may mean that you could save us, or it may mean that you
       could bring about our destruction. But our time is running out. The few
       of us left free of control cannot protect ourselves for much longer.
       You must go to Saering's Watch. Learn there the Word Miraak learned long
       ago, and use that knowledge on the Wind Stone. You may be able to break
       the hold on our people there, and free them from control.

       What do you know about Miraak?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Much of what was known has been lost to the ages. He was Dragonborn,
        and yet he served the dragons. A priest in their order, highly esteemed
        and very powerful. Then he turned against them, becoming something they
        feared. He was defeated long ago, but it seems he was never destroyed.

       What do you mean, "free your people from control?"
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Some dark influence wields power over them, forces them to forget
        themselves and act against their nature. At first it was only during
        the night, but now every moment is spent building some strange shrine
        around the Wind Stone. I believe if the shrine can be destroyed, the
        Skaal will be free once more.

       Why do I need to learn a Word of Power?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Miraak is behind what's happening to our village, and so the knowledge
        he has gained as Dragonborn is at the heart of it. You are Dragonborn
        as well. You too can wield this power, perhaps to a better end.

       All-Maker shelter you.

[After getting part of the Bend Will Shout at the destination, one returns to
 the Wind Stone and uses it. The profane shrine crumbles, and a slimy Lurker
 appears for everyone to neutralize. Everyone returns to the village.]

Storn: The air is different. We are safe, which means you have succeeded.

Dragonborn: Your people are free.

Storn: So it is. You have proven yourself an ally to the Skaal, and so the
       Skaal shall be allies to you.

Dragonborn: What do we do now?

Storn: If you have released the Wind Stone and broken the hold on my people,
       perhaps you can do the same for the rest of Solstheim. I doubt it will
       fully stop whatever Miraak is doing, but it may slow his progress.

Dragonborn: That's not enough. I need to stop Miraak now.

Storn: I cannot help with that. None here can. You will need the knowledge
       Miraak himself learned. You will need to learn more about this Black
       Book.

Dragonborn: Tell me more about this book, then.

Storn: Miraak had this? This does not look like something of the Dragon cult.
       It is a dark thing, unnatural. I would have nothing to do with it. But
       the Dark Elf Wizard, Neloth... He came to us sometime ago, asking about
       the Black Books. I believe he knows a great deal about them. Perhaps too
       much. Seek him to the south. Be cautious, Dragonborn. There is something
       else at work here.

[To the south is a gigantic house made from a Morrowind mushroom -- Neloth's
 private mansion, Tel Mithryn. Two people are outside, one practicing his
 spellcasting.]

Varona: Why are you out here? Aren't you supposed to be in the tower assisting
        Master Neloth?

Talvas: Why won't this summoning work? If you must know, I'm trying to get this
        Ash Guardian spell to work. Now let me concentrate. Besides, shouldn't
        you be worrying about the damage to the tower?

Varona: Master Neloth has tasked Elynea with repairing the tower. Why aren't
        you doing this in the lab, where it would be safer for all of us?

Talvas: The, uh...the lab is too small. Also, I need the ashy soil. Master
        Neloth knows what I'm doing. No need to bother him about it though.
        He's quite busy at the moment

Varona: It's on your head if something goes wrong. Just let me get back inside
        first.

Talvas: No Ash Guardian. Maybe the book has something.

[She notices the player is approaching.]

Varona: We don't get many visitors. Is there something you need?

        What is this place?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Tel Mithryn. It's the home of Master Neloth. You may have heard of
         him. He's a famous Telvanni wizard.

         He lives in a giant mushroom?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          In Morrowind, the Telvanni grow buildings from special fungus spores.
          Master Neloth grew one here to be his home. Don't ask me how.

         Are you one of Neloth's apprentices?
         ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
          No. Talvas is his apprentice. I'm his steward. I manage the day to
          day¹ affairs of Tel Mithryn.

        Who else lives here?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Talvas is Master Neloth's apprentice. If you are interested in spells,
         he might be willing to sell you some. Elynea is our alchemist. She
         specializes in mushrooms and other types of fungus. Ulves runs the
         kitchens.

[One goes up to visit the famous wizard in the largest mushroom tower.]

Neloth: You again? Didn't I see you in Raven Rock?

Dragonborn: I hear you know where to find Black Books.

Neloth: You refer to the tomes of esoteric knowledge that old Hermaeus Mora
        has scattered throughout the world? Is this somehow connected to your
        search for Miraak?

        I found a Black Book. I need to find more.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Found one? Yes, and you read it, too, didn't you? Don't try to deny
         it, you've got the look. I can see it now. Dangerous knowledge is
         still knowledge and therefore useful. Usually turns out to be the most
         useful, in my experience.

        The Black Books have something to do with Hermaeus Mora?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You didn't know? Hmm, I thought it was obvious. Hermaeus Mora has
         always tried to seduce mortals into his service with the lure of
         forbidden knowledge. Where the Black Books actually came from...no one
         really knows. Some appear to have been written far in the past, others
         might be from the future. Apparently time is more malleable if you're
         the Daedric Prince of fate and destiny.

        Who is Hermaeus Mora?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         If you have to ask that, you'd probably be best leaving his books to
         wiser heads than yours. Like all Daedric Princes, he's not to be
         trifled with. But he is subtler than most of his ilk, appropriate for
         the prince of knowledge and fate. Many scholars and loremasters have
         been ensnared by the lure of learning secrets that only Hermaeus Mora
         possesses. But don't worry. I have no intention of joining them in
         their endless search though the infinite halls of Apocrypha.

Dragonborn: I have to know what Miraak knows if I want to stop him.

Neloth: Now that is a dangerous path indeed. Hermaeus Mora gives nothing away
        for free. You may end up like Miraak, of course. Two power-mad
        Dragonborn. It could be very interesting.

Dragonborn: Do you know where I can find another Black Book?

Neloth: Oh yes. They're not hard to locate once you know how to look for them.
        I have one here that I've been using to locate more.

Dragonborn: You have a Black Book?

Neloth: Yes. I haven't been idle while this fascinating madness engulfed
        Solstheim. But my book isn't what you're looking for. I'm quite sure
        it's unconnected with this Miraak. But I do know where to find a Black
        Book that can help you.

        So you know where to find this Black Book? The one connected with
        Miraak? |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes, I do. I haven't been able to get it, though. But maybe together
         we can unlock the secrets the Dwemer left behind.

          The Dwemer? What do they have to do with this?
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           Forbidden knowledge was somewhat of a specialty of the dwarves, eh?
           You don't think they would just leave it alone, do you?

          Just tell me where the book is and I'll go get it.
          ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
           I'm afraid it isn't that simple. If it was, I would have the book
           already.

          It seems the ancient Dwemer discovered this book and took it to
          study. I found their "reading room" in the ruins of Nchardak. The
          book is there, but it's sealed in a protective case which I wasn't
          able to open. But perhaps the two of us together will be able to get
          at the book. To Nchardak, then. Follow me.

        Why won't the book you have here help me?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Oh, it is clearly not associated with the same power that has
         overtaken the island. And I'm not talking about Hermaeus Mora. These
         Black Books are all his, of course. No, what you're looking for is a
         specific book. Presumably because Miraak's power derives from it.

[Neloth takes the player to the seaside Dwemer ruins.]

Neloth: The Dwemer certainly know how to build for the ages. These towers have
        outlasted their creators by millenia¹. The book is housed inside that
        dome. I'll need to unlock the door for us. Let's get on with it.

[Reaver bandits attack.]

Neloth: I had to clean out the riff-raff last time I was here, too. Where do
        they come from?

[They finally slay the outdoor assailants and approach the locked entrance.]

Neloth: The Dwemer of Nchardak appear to have been fond of these control
        pedestals. Luckily I found a cube to operate it inside on my last
        visit. I sealed the door when I left to keep out ignorant meddlers.
        Let me unlock it. The book is just inside.

[The two visit inside. The target item is visible in the floor, under a thick
 protective cover.]

Neloth: You can see the book right there. So tantalizingly close...but trust
        me, no magic will open that. I'd have had the book already if it could.
        No, we'll have to do this the hard way. If we can restore the steam
        supply to this room, I'm certain I can open it. As you'll see, that's
        easier said than done. This way to the boilers. Follow me.

[The elevator takes them into the desolate, flooded boiler room.]

Neloth: The last time I was here, I only explored a small portion of the ruins.
        I was here alone then, and I find an assistant is absolutely essential
        for this kind of dirty, dangerous work. Nchardak. The "City of a
        Hundred Towers". In its day, it was the largest of the great Dwemer
        Archives, and perhaps the most advanced. In the old stories, when the
        Nords came to conquer it, it's said the Dwemer submerged the entire
        city beneath the sea until the invaders gave up. I have my doubts. But
        the city was a marvel of Dwemer engineering. Now...reduced to this. As
        you can see, most of the lower levels of the city are flooded. But it
        isn't hopeless -- the old Dwemer pumps still seem to work. Watch.

[He uses a control pedestal, draining part of the room.]

Neloth: But the pumps only operate when a cube is in the pedestal. And
        unfortunately, I only have one cube. These four boilers provide steam
        to the room upstairs. They're shut down, but they still respond to the
        control cubes. So, if we can find four more cubes, we can turn these
        boilers back on and restore steam power to the room upstairs. Then I
        should be able to open the book's protective case. Bring that cube.
        We'll need it.

[One takes the cube and visits Neloth at an old Dwemer control panel.]

Neloth: Yes...here we are. This device shows the location of four more cubes
        in this section of the city. It looks like most of the cubes were moved
        to the lower levels; perhaps to try to control the flooding before the
        city was abandoned. Interesting. That would suggest that the city must
        have originally sunk during the first cataclysm of Red Mountain. Or
        that the Dwemer's servitors continued to try to preserve the city after
        their creators' disappearance.

[He stops at a door.]

Neloth: Three of the cubes are through here. This seems like a sensible place
        to start. You should be able to unseal this door with the control cube
        I gave you.

[They enter the adjacent workshop. A cube is sitting a few steps away.]

Neloth: I hope the rest of the cubes arethis easy to find. Although knowing the
        Dwemer, I rather doubt it.

[A long, half-flooded chamber is nearby.]

Neloth: These must be the "Great Workshops of Nchardak". Impressive even in
        ruins. In the city's days of glory, it was reputed to be able to
        assemble a complete automaton in a single day. Much of the Dwemer army
        at the Battle of Red Mountain must have come from here. It looks like
        we'll need to lower the water level to make any more progress.

[Using the cubes, the room is drained.]

Neloth: Ah, good. Now we can see if we can find a way to get that next cube.

[Some Centurions come to life.]

Neloth: There seems to be an inexhaustible suply of these Dwemer contraptions.

[They claim a third cube still in use.]

Neloth: Unfortunately, each cube we retrieve shuts down the corresponding
        pumps, raising the water level. We'll have to be careful.

[They end up reflooding the room, gaining access to a broken passage.]

Neloth: Let's see where this leads. With the water level this high, we can swim
        right across the collapsed part of the passage and reach the other
        side.

[Soon after, they find another cube.]

Neloth: Very good. By my count, we've found a total of four cubes. Assuming
        you haven't dropped any anywhere.

[They return to the first area of the boilery.]

Neloth: You'll need to lower the water level before we can proceed any further.

[Soon, it's time to visit the aqueduct.]

Neloth: The last cube is somewhere in here. I hope it won't require more
        swimming around in this filth. I'd guess that must be the pump
        activator up there. But how to reach it? We'll need to get all three
        of these bridges down in order to reach the pump control.

[The player fiddles with the cube controls.]

Neloth: That's it! Don't touch anything else. Quickly now.

[They kill some automatons.]

Neloth: What a mess. I'm getting tired of wading around in this muck. I have
        an idea. I'll wait here and retrieve this cube once you find the last
        one we need. Good luck!

[Nearby, one retrieves the last cube from its booby-trapped pedestal.]

Neloth: Do you have the cube? Good, good! Then I'll take this cube and we can
        be on our way. Watch out. The water's rising even higher with both
        pumps shut down. That was easier than I expected. I'm glad you were
        here to do all the hard work. With the cube I retrieved from the
        pumping pedestal, we should now have five cubes -- exactly what we
        need. Now we can finally see about getting those boilers started.

[For the last time, everyone returns to Nchardak's boilery.]

Neloth: You'll need the cube I picked up to start all the boilers. Here, I
        picked this up this cube for you.

[All boilers are put back in action.]

Neloth: That seems to have done it. Good. It took longer than I'd hoped, but
        at least it's finally done. Look out, another Steam Centurion!

[They kill the final foe.]

Neloth: I'm going to head back upstairs and see if the reading room has steam.
        If so, it should be a simple matter to release the book.

[Everyone travels upstairs.]

Neloth: Yes, it worked! The steam is flowing. Now it should be as simple as...
        That should do it.

[The case recedes and the book rises up into plain view.]

Neloth: At last. I hope it was worth it. Please...be my guest. You deserve the
        first look. Besides, it could be very dangerous. These books are known
        to drive many people insane.

Hermaeus Mora: • So, another seeker after knowledge enters my realm.

                 hidden here. If so, welcome. Perhaps you are a fool or a
                 coward. If so, you are in peril. Read your book again and
                 escape before Apocrypha claims you forever.

               • Sate your thirst for knowledge in the endless stacks of my
                 library. If you tire of your search, read your book again to
                 return to your mortal life. For a time. The lure of Apocrypha
                 will call you back. It is your fate.

[The player navigates the book's chapters to reach the end.]

Hermaeus Mora: • All seekers of knowledge come to me, sooner or later.
               • Well done, my champion. Your journey towards enlightenment
                 has finally lead you here, to my realm, as I knew it would.

               Who are you?²
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                I am Hermaeus Mora, the Gardener of Men, knower of the unknown,
                master of fates. You stand in my realm, mortal.

               What do you want of me? / What do you want of me this time?²
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                You have entered my realm. You have sought out the forbidden
                knowledge that only one other has obtained. You are Dragonborn,
                like Miraak before you. A seeker of knowledge and power.

               What do you want me of this time, my lord?²
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                Your progress since obtaining my Oghma Infinium has been rapid.
                And now, I find you here, following in my servant Miraak's
                footsteps. You also are Dragonborn. You also seek how to bend
                the world to your will.

               Don't worry, I was just leaving.²
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                No. Not yet. I have watched your progress through my realm with
                growing interest. You are following in the footsteps of my
                servant, Miraak. Like him, you are Dragonborn, and seek the
                power that is your birthright.

                Yes, I came here to learn Miraak's secrets.
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 All that he knows he learned from me.

                I won't serve you, monster. I just want to defeat Miraak.
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 You will serve me, willing or not. All who seek after the
                 secrets of the world are my servants.

                I don't need your help. I'll learn Miraak's secrets on my own.
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 No. Look around you. You have done nothing here on your own.
                 You could spend a hundred lifetimes searching my library, and
                 you will never find what you seek.

               I know what you want: to use your power as Dragonborn to bend
               the world to your will. Here then is the knowledge you need,
               although you did not know you needed it. The second Word of
               Power. Use it to bend the will of mortals to your purpose. But
               this is not enough. Miraak knows the final Word of Power.
               Without that, you cannot hope to surpass him. Miraak served me
               well, and was rewarded. I can grant you the same power as he
               wields, but all knowledge has its price.

               So what's your price for the final Word of Power?
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                Knowledge for knowledge.

               Tell me what you want, my lord, and I will bring it to you.²
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                You please me, champion. Your loyalty will be richly rewarded.

               The Skaal have withheld their secrets from me for many long
               years. The time has come for this knowledge to be added to my
               library.

                I will talk to the Skaal and bring you their secrets.
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 I know you will. And then I will give you the knowledge that
                 you seek.

                I will do as you command, my lord.
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 Yes, I know. And then Miraak's power will be yours as well.

                What if the Skaal refuse to give up their secrets?
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 My servant Miraak would have found a way to bring me what I
                 want. So will you, if you wish to surpass him.

                How do I know I can trust you, demon?
                ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                 My word is as true as fate, as inevitable as destiny. Bring me
                 what I want, and I will give you what you seek.

               Why do I need this Word of Power to defeat Miraak?
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                Even dragons submit to Miraak's Voice. Without that power, you
                cannot face him. So say I, Hermaeus Mora, master of the tides
                of Fate.

               Isn't Miraak your ally? Why help me defeat him?
               ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
                He has served me long and well. But he grows restless under my
                guidance. His desire to return to your world will spread my
                influence more widely. But it will also set him free from my
                direct control. It may be time to replace him with a more loyal
                servant. One who still appreciates the gifts that I have to
                offer.

               Send the Skaal shaman to me. He holds the secrets that will be
               mine.

[The player finally exits the book, being transported back to Nchardak.]

Neloth: What happened? What did you see? Different people have very different
        experiences when reading these books.

        I talked to Hermaeus Mora.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         You're still surprisingly sane, too. What did he have to say? He must
         have wanted something from you.

        I learned the second Word of the Bend Will Shout.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         No wonder the Dwemer were so interested in that book. It was indeed
         one that Miraak used to advance his power as Dragonborn. But I assume
         there's some bad news. It would be unlike Hermaeus Mora to allow
         anyone to gain such knowledge without exacting a price.

Dragonborn: He wants the "secrets of the Skaal" in exchange for teaching me
            the third Word.

Neloth: Hmph. What secrets could they have worth keeping from old Mora? Sounds
        like a bargain to me. Hermaeus Mora learns some fascinating new ways to
        skin a horker, and you become the second most powerful Dragonborn that
        ever lived. Well, that gives me a lot to think about. I need to get
        back to Tel Mithryn. I have some ideas about how to locate more of
        these Black Books...

[With the sojourn over, the player exits outside, finding a dragon waiting.]

Krosulhah: When Miraak returns, all will bow before him!

[They kill the dragon, but a projection of Miraak appears, taking the soul.]

Miraak: This dragon's soul belongs to me. One step closer to my return.

[After, it's back to Skaal Village to find Storn.]

Dragonborn: I spoke to Hermaeus Mora. He asked for the "secrets of the Skaal."

Storn: Hermaeus Mora...old Herma-Mora himself. So he is the source of Miraak's
       power. Of course. We have many tales of Herma-Mora trying to trick us
       into giving up our secrets to him. And now he comes again for what we
       have long kept from him.

       He said that's the only way he'll teach me the final Word of Miraak's
       Shout. |¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        So it falls to me to be the one to give up our secrets to our ancient
        enemy. I do not know if I have the strength to face him. The Tree Stone
        is still corrupted...the land is still out of balance. But with the
        other five restored...it may be enough. It will have to be.

        You mean you'll give him what he wants?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Yes. The Skaal also tell of the day when we must finally give up our
         secrets. When Herma-Mora finally wins. As shaman, it is my duty to
         guard these secrets, but also to decide when it is necessary to give
         them up. I believe that time is now. If I am wrong, may my ancestors
         forgive me. Give me the book. I will read it, and speak to old
         Herma-Mora myself. I will make sure he lives up to his part of the
         bargain.

       What are the "secrets of the Skall"?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Ancient lore, handed down from shaman to shaman since the All-Maker
        first gave Solstheim to the Skaal. How to talk to the wind, how to
        listen to the earth -- these are our secrets. Nothing of power or
        mastery.

        Why would Hermaeus Mora want your secrets?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         We know him as Herma-Mora, the Demon of Knowledge. It is in his nature
         to hoard secrets for himself. Their value to him is of no consequence.
         The very fact that the Skaal have kept knowledge from him has merely
         increased his desire to have it.

       Herma-Mora? Why do you call him that?
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        That is our name for him -- the Demon of Knowledge. He has always been
        our enemy.

Dragonborn: I hope you know what you're doing. (Give book)

Storn: That is my hope as well. I am trusting that you will make this sacrifice
       worthwhile.

Frea: Father, you must not do this. That book is...wrong. Evil. Against
      everything that you have taught me my whole life.

Storn: I must, Frea. It is the only way to free Solstheim forever from Miraak's
       shadow. There comes a time when everything must change. Nothing that
       lives remains the same forever. Do not fear for me, my daughter. This is
       the destiny that the All-Maker has laid out for me.

Frea: I stand beside you, father, as always.

Storn: I am ready for whatever the foul master of this book has in store for
       me.

[He opens the book; dark tendrils dig into his mind as Herma-Mora manifests.]

Hermaeus Mora: At last, the Skaal yield up their secrets to me.

Frea: Father! No, stop! 

Storn: You...liar...gah!...I won't...not...for you...

Frea: Do something!

Hermaeus Mora: Dragonborn, you have delivered me the gift I requested. In
               return, I keep my promise, as befits a Prince of Oblivion: I
               give you the Word of Power that you need to challenge Miraak.
               You will be either a worthy opponent or his successor, as the
               tides of fate decree.

Storn: Nooo...

[Storn crumples to the floor, dead. Herma-Mora disappears.]

Frea: Father! What have you done? Go. My father sacrificed himself so that you
      could destroy Miraak and lift his master's shadow from the land. Go,
      then. Kill Miraak. Do not fail.

[The other Skaal come to pay their respects at the body.]

Fanari Strong-Voice: Goodbye, old friend. We will miss you, but do not worry.
                     Frea will guide us well, thanks to you.

Edla: We won't forget what you did for us, Storn Crag-Strider. Walk with the
      All-Maker.

Deor Woodcutter: Frea...I'm sorry.

Aeta: It can't be...please, All-Maker, send him back to us...

Finna: May the All-Maker guide your soul to the next life.

Nikulas: Frea...what happened? What was that thing? I thought the village was
         safe now.

Wulf Wild-Blood: Return to the All-Maker, old one. The Skaal will never forget
                 your sacrifice.

Morwen: I don't really understand what you did, but I trust you did it for the
        good of the village. So...thank you.

Tharstan: By the gods...I've never seen anything like it...I, uh...I don't
          think this will go in my book.

[DR07] AT THE SUMMIT OF APOCRYPHA |============================================
__________________________________|
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
[With the full Thu'um attained, one reads the Waking Dreams book to reenter
 Hermaeus Mora's realm. With its nightmarish libraries navigated, one finds a
 Word Wall. Miraak's dragon Sahrotaar is nearby, and easily falls prey to the
 Bend Will Shout.]

Sahrotaar: Hail, thuri. Your thu'um has the mastery. Climb aboard and I will
           carry you to Miraak.

[The player hangs on as Sahrotaar heads for a distant, isolated tower.]

Sahrotaar: Beware. Miraak is strong. He knew you would come here.

[They land on the tower. The enemy Dragonborn is patiently waiting.]

Miraak: Sahrotaar, are you so easily swayed?

[Sahrotaar talks again.]

Miraak: No. Not yet. We should greet our guest first. And so the First
        Dragonborn meets the Last Dragonborn at the summit of Apocrypha. No
        doubt just as Hermaeus Mora intended. He is a fickle master, you know.
        But now I will be free of him. My time in Apocrypha is over. You are
        here in your full power, and thus subject to my full power. You will
        die. And with the power of your soul, I will return to Solstheim and
        be master of my own fate once again. Kruziikrel! Relonikiv! Now!

[Miraak's other two dragons appear, and Sahrotaar flies off to fight them.]

Miraak: So easily you betray me, after all these years.

[When weakened, Miraak calls to his dragon...]

Miraak: Kruziikrel, ziil los dii du!

[...and steals its soul when it lands. He repeats this for his other helper.]

Miraak: Relonikiv, ziil los dii du!

[He regains his health yet again.]

Miraak: Fate decreed that you had to die so that I could win my freedom.

[Finally, he calls his final dragon to its demise.]

Miraak: Sahrotaar, ziil los dii du!

[Finally, after all Miraak's embarrassing shenanigans, Hermaeus Mora stops him
 mid-teleport and raises him into the air.]

Hermaeus Mora: Did you think to escape me, Miraak? You can hide nothing from me
               here. No matter. I have found a new Dragonborn to serve me.

Miraak: May he be rewarded for her service as I am!

[Herma-Mora's tentacle impales him, slaying him permanently.]

Hermaeus Mora: Miraak harbored fantasies of rebellion against me. Learn from
               his example. Serve me faithfully, and you will continue to be
               richly rewarded.

[With the threat to Solstheim averted, the player returns triumphant. That
 ends the questline properly. If one revisits Skaal Village:]

Frea: I can feel it. The Tree Stone is free again. The Oneness of the land is
      is restored. Does that mean...is it over? Is Miraak defeated?

      It's over. Miraak is dead.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Then my father's sacrifice...it was not in vain. He died to free us.
       Tell me...was it the only way? Did he need to die?

       I couldn't have defeated Miraak without Storn's help.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Then...it was the All-Maker's will, as he said. I know I should not
        doubt it. But it is good to hear, all the same. Thank you.

       Hermaeus Mora killed Storn, remember. Not Miraak.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        I know. The Skaal will not forget this. Storn's death will become
        another of the many tales of Herma-Mora's treachery.

       Hermaeus Mora wouldn't have helped me without Storn's sacrifice.
       ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
        Yes, his "help" which did not require him to kill my father. Such is
        the way of Herma-Mora, the eternal enemy of the Skaal.

      Storn didn't die for nothing. Miraak will never threaten Solstheim again.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       Thank you. Whatever your other reasons for acting, you have done the
       Skaal a great service. We will not forget what you've done.

      I killed Miraak. But Hermaeus Mora is still out there.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       It was Miraak who threatened Solstheim. With him gone, Herma-Mora has
       been foiled once again. Tell me, though...my father's death...was it
       necessary? Was there no other way to destroy Miraak?

      One more thing, Skaal-friend, if you will. I know it is not my place,
      but...may I offer a word of advice...of warning?

      Sure, what is it?
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       As shaman of the Skaal, I am charged with the spiritual well-being of
       my people. While you are not of the Skaal, you are Skall-friend, and so
       I give you this warning. Herma-Mora forced you to serve him in order to
       defeat Miraak. Do not let him lure you further down that path. The
       All-Maker made you Dragonborn for a higher purpose. Do not forget that.
       Walk with the All-Maker, Skaal-friend.

      I don't need your advice.
      ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
       I understand. Walk with the All-Maker, Dragonborn.

[If one revisits Neloth to update him about the goings-on:]

Neloth: Hold still. Let me get a good look at you.

Dragonborn: What are you looking for?

Neloth: Incipient madness. Loss of self-awareness. Black spots in the whites
        of the eyes. Any of the documented indications of Hermaeus Mora's
        permanent influence. Hmm, no, you look fine. Well, at least no
        different than when I first saw you.

        Don't you want to know what happened with Miraak?
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         Who? Oh him. Well, I assume you killed him. Or Hermaeus Mora turned on
         him when you looked like the winning bet. Or a bit of both.

        You don't need to worry about me.
        ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
         I wasn't worried. Just interested. I don't get to observe first-hand
         many people who've spoken to Hermaeus Mora.
