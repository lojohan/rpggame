I remembered how awesome this was so I dug it up. Dunno where you can find video, but even in transcript form it's awesome.

KING: What is Morrowind?

CARTER: This is probably the most exciting thing that I've done to date. It is a roleplaying game for PC and for the new Xbox that's coming out. And I do the voices of the Nords, all the women.

KING: People buy this as a game?

CARTER: It's a game for the computer or Xbox, the new Microsoft...

KING: That's coming.

CARTER: Xbox is out now. It's like, you know, Dreamcast and PlayStation and that sort of thing.

KING: And the user plays a game with the figures, with the people?

CARTER: You can choose -- it's kind of the most advanced in terms of all the technology because there's no right or wrong way to play the game. So you can choose to be a bad guy, a good guy, a hero. And you make all these choices as to -- and it can go in thousands of different directions.

KING: What does Morrowind mean?

CARTER: Ooooh, what does Morrowind mean?

KING: It is just a grabber title?

CARTER: No, it's the third in the installment of the Elder Scrolls.

KING: The Elder Scrolls. Oh, the Elder Scrolls is the name of the series?

CARTER: Morrowind is this...

KING: And that's out now. And who do you play?

CARTER: I play all of the voices of the Nords. And the Nords, I'm going to read it, aggressive and warlike race, women. All of the races in the game, their roles vary widely. And you can go throughout the world and they're employed in all kinds of jobs and this and that except they really like the combat arts. And it is probably the most fascinating, interesting, creative thing and most fun thing that I have done in a long time.

KING: And the third installment is out now?

CARTER: No, coming out in, I think, in April.

KING: Morrowind.

CARTER: Morrowind.
